# WOD Wiki

A React component library for parsing, displaying, and executing workout definitions using a specialized syntax. Features include a Monaco Editor integration for editing workout scripts, a runtime engine for execution, and components styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Current Status

WOD Wiki has a mature foundation for parsing workout scripts and a set of core execution features (as of v0.5.0). Key implemented aspects include:

*   **Workout Script Parsing:** A comprehensive syntax (see [wod-wiki/Syntax.md](wod-wiki/Syntax.md)) allows defining diverse workout structures. The parser translates these scripts into an internal representation.
*   **Workout Execution Core (v0.5.0):**
    *   **Results Tracking:** Robust tracking of metrics (effort, reps, resistance, distance) with inline editing, filtering, and exercise summary cards.
    *   **Audio Cues & ChromeCast Integration:** Sound effects for workout events and ability to cast workouts.
    *   **UI/UX:** Refined results display, responsive layouts, and editor syntax highlighting.
*   **Exercise Typeahead Integration (NEW):**
    *   **Intelligent Suggestions:** Real-time exercise name completion for 873+ exercises as you type in the Monaco Editor.
    *   **Rich Metadata:** Equipment 🏋️, muscles 💪, and difficulty ⭐ icons displayed inline with suggestions.
    *   **Hover Documentation:** Rich hover cards showing exercise details including muscles, equipment, difficulty, and instructions.
    *   **High Performance:** Debounced search (150ms), LRU caching (100 exercises), and localStorage index caching for fast response (< 10ms search, < 1ms cached load).
    *   **Error Resilience:** Retry logic with exponential backoff, 500ms timeout, and graceful fallbacks.
    *   **12 Storybook Stories:** Interactive demonstrations of all features including equipment filtering, muscle targeting, and difficulty levels.
    *   See [Exercise Typeahead Implementation Guide](./docs/exercise-typeahead-implementation-guide.md) for full details.
*   **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler Architecture:**
    *   The architectural design is established, including phases for Fragment Compilation, Metric Inheritance, Block Creation, and Stack Execution.
    *   An enhanced Storybook demonstration ([stories/compiler/JitCompiler.stories.tsx](stories/compiler/JitCompiler.stories.tsx)) showcases real-time visualization of compilation, runtime stack, and memory allocation.
    *   Shared fragment visualization components ([src/components/fragments/](src/components/fragments/)) provide reusable UI for parsing and displaying workout script fragments.
*   **Metric Inheritance System:**
    *   The core system for metric inheritance (allowing parent blocks to influence child metrics) is implemented and tested.
    *   Includes `IMetricInheritance` interface, `MetricComposer`, `RuntimeMetric` types, and example patterns.
    *   Integrated into the JIT Compiler design as a distinct phase.

## Runtime Test Bench

The **Runtime Test Bench** is an interactive development and debugging tool for WOD Wiki workout scripts. It provides a complete workflow for editing, parsing, compiling, and executing workout definitions with real-time runtime visualization.

### Features

- **Integrated Monaco Editor** with syntax highlighting and auto-parse (500ms debounce)
- **Real-time Compilation** with JIT compiler and three optimization strategies
- **Runtime Execution** at 10 steps/second with NextEvent-based advancement
- **Debugger Controls**: Pause, resume, single-step, stop, and reset
- **Live Visualization**: Runtime stack, memory allocations, and execution status
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** for efficient workflow
- **Performance Optimized**: <100ms parse, <500ms compile, >30fps UI, no memory leaks

### Quick Start

View in Storybook:
```bash
npm run storybook
# Navigate to: Runtime Test Bench → Default
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | State |
|----------|--------|-------|

# Run performance tests
npx vitest run tests/integration/RuntimeTestBench.performance.test.tsx
```

## In Progress / Next Steps

Current development focuses on fully implementing and integrating the JIT Compiler and its runtime environment:

*   **Full JIT Compiler Runtime Implementation:**
    *   **Concrete Runtime Components:** Replace placeholder/mock runtime parts (e.g., `IRuntimeBlock` implementations, `ITimerRuntime`) with functional versions.
    *   **Metric Inheritance Integration:** Update `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` implementations and `IRuntimeBlock.inherit()` methods to use the metric inheritance system. Integrate with `FragmentCompilationManager`.
*   **End-to-End JIT Compilation Pipeline:** Ensure all JIT phases (parsing to execution) are fully connected and operational with real components.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the integrated JIT compiler and runtime.

## Future Enhancements

Post JIT-integration, planned enhancements include:

*   **Advanced Metric Inheritance:** Implement more sophisticated, context-aware inheritance patterns.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze and optimize the JIT compiler and runtime.
*   **Expanded Language Features:** Refine workout syntax based on feedback.
*   **Enhanced Developer Tooling:** Improve debugging and diagnostic tools.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for the components, architecture, and workout syntax can be found in the `docs` directory:

[Project Documentation](./docs/Welcome.md)

The documentation in the `docs` directory is automatically published to the project's [GitHub Wiki](../../wiki) whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

For more in-depth design documents, working notes, and release details, please also refer to the `wod-wiki/` directory within this repository.

## Development

This project uses Storybook for component development and visualization.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### **Run Storybook:**

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook development server, typically on `http://localhost:6006`.

## Building the Library

To build the library for publishing or use in other projects:

```shell
npm run build
```

This command will:

1. Compile TypeScript types (`tsc`).
2. Bundle the library code using Vite into the `dist` folder (creating ES and UMD formats).
3. Process and output the Tailwind CSS into `dist/style.css`.

## Building Storybook

To build a static version of the Storybook application (e.g., for deployment):

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

This will output the static Storybook site to the `storybook-static` directory.

> **Note**: This project uses Storybook 9.0.4. The dark mode functionality is temporarily disabled pending community addon compatibility updates.

## Consuming the Package

### **Install the package:**

```bash
npm install @bitcobblers/wod-wiki
```

### **Install Peer Dependencies:**

Ensure your project has the required peer dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install react react-dom monaco-editor
```

### **Import the component and styles:**

```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { WodWikiEditor } from '@bitcobblers/wod-wiki'; // Example component import
    import '@bitcobblers/wod-wiki/dist/style.css'; // Import the necessary CSS

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>My App</h1>
          <WodWikiEditor 
            language="javascript" 
            initialValue="console.log('Hello from Monaco!');" 
          />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    *Important:* Ensure your application's build process can handle CSS imports and that Tailwind CSS (if used directly in the consuming application) doesn't conflict. The provided `style.css` contains the necessary Tailwind styles for the components.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests using Vitest:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Storybook Tests

Run interaction tests in Storybook:

1. First, make sure Storybook is running:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

2. In a separate terminal, run the Storybook test runner:

```shell
npm run test-storybook
```

This will run all interaction tests defined in the stories using Playwright. The tests are defined in the `play` function of the stories, such as the timer test in `src/stories/TimerTest.stories.tsx`.
