# WOD Wiki

**Write workouts as Markdown. Run them on a clock. Analyze what actually happened.**

WOD Wiki is a TypeScript monorepo toolkit for parsing, executing, and analyzing workouts written in Whiteboard Language (`wod` / `time` blocks) embedded in ordinary Markdown. It includes CodeMirror 6 editor integrations, a Just-In-Time compiler, a reactive execution runtime, and a training-analytics engine.

> Documentation: [`docs/`](./docs/README.md), [`docs/domain-model/`](./docs/domain-model/), and [WQL query composition](./docs/prototypes/WQL-Domain-Query-Composition.md).

---

## Getting started

WOD Wiki has two hosting levels. Both run the same playground application; the difference is where your data lives. A container runs server mode, not a third storage mode.

| Hosting level | Data storage | How to run it |
|---|---|---|
| Playground | IndexedDB in each browser. No API or database server required. | [Bun playground](#run-the-playground-with-bun) |
| Server | SQL behind the Bun API. Browsers connecting to the same server use the same backend data. | [Bun server](#run-the-server-with-bun) or [container](#run-the-server-in-a-container) |

Choose Playground for browser-local use and development. Choose Server to keep durable app data outside the browser. Switching modes does not move existing browser data into SQL.

### Run the playground with Bun

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.4 or newer, then run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
bun run playground
```

Open the Vite URL printed in the terminal, normally [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). This command builds the packages, lints the playground, and starts the development server with hot reload. Your journal and workout data stay in that browser's IndexedDB; clearing browser storage removes them.

### Run the server with Bun

With Bun installed, run from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
bun run server
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). The command builds the packages and API-enabled playground into `apps/playground/dist-api`, then starts [`apps/api`](./apps/api/) to serve both the app and API from one origin. The default database is `./data/wodwiki.db`, a local SQLite file accessed through `@libsql/client`, the same driver used for Turso.

Keep the `data` directory to preserve your data between launches. After a build, `bun run start:server` starts the server without rebuilding. Ordinary playground builds use `apps/playground/dist`, separate from the server build.

See [database configuration](#configure-the-server-database) to use remote Turso or PostgreSQL, or override the local SQLite path.

### Run the server in a container

Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Docker builds the API-enabled playground and runs it with the Bun API. Bun is not required on the host. If Bun is installed, `bun run docker` runs the same command.

The default SQLite database is `/data/wodwiki.db` inside the container, persisted in the Compose `wodwiki-data` named volume. Stop the application with `docker compose down`; the volume remains. `docker compose down -v` deletes that volume and its local database.

[`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) reads `DB_DRIVER`, `DATABASE_URL`, `LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SQLITE_PATH`, and the host `PORT` from your shell or a root `.env` file. Copy the settings you need from [`.env.example`](./.env.example). For local SQLite, keep the container path under `/data` so it remains on the persistent volume. For PostgreSQL, the connection URL must point to a database reachable from the container; `localhost` refers to the container itself.

### Configure the server database

Local SQLite is the default. To select another database for a Bun launch, set its environment variables inline or export them in your shell:

```bash
# Local SQLite at a chosen path
SQLITE_PATH=./data/training.db bun run server

# Remote Turso
DB_DRIVER=turso DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-db.turso.io LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token bun run server

# PostgreSQL, using an existing database
DB_DRIVER=postgres DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/wodwiki bun run server
```

For a container launch, use the same database variables with `docker compose up --build`, or set them in the root `.env` file. Do not commit database credentials. [`.env.example`](./.env.example) also documents `HOST`, `PORT`, and `PLAYGROUND_DIST` for native Bun launches.

A fresh database uses the current schema version. The server refuses incompatible schemas and does not import legacy Rust `wod-wiki-api` databases.

In server mode, durable app data lives in SQL: journal, collections, efforts, sessions, notebooks, query shortcuts, calculators, and telemetry. Theme, audio, onboarding, cast pairing, telemetry consent, and per-route view settings stay browser-local.

### Before exposing a server

The server is a single-user trusted deployment without authentication. Native Bun binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Docker binds to `0.0.0.0` inside the container, and Compose publishes the port on the host. Add access control before exposing it publicly. Connecting several browsers does not create separate user accounts.

### Development tools and checks

Storybook is a separate component workbench, not another hosting level:

```bash
bun run storybook       # http://localhost:6006
bun run test
bun run check:server
```

`check:server` exercises CRUD, transactions, domain queries, static serving, and database reopen against a temporary SQLite file. To check PostgreSQL or Turso, set `DB_DRIVER`, `DATABASE_URL`, any `LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `WOD_CHECK_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`. Use a disposable database: this check wipes its data.

See [monorepo scripts](#monorepo-scripts) for other commands, [architecture at a glance](#architecture-at-a-glance) for the package map, and the [architecture overview](./docs/architecture/overview.md) for the workout-processing pipeline.

## The big idea: everything is a metric

```
Markdown  →  Metrics (the plan)  →  Tracking metrics (what happened)  →  Analyzed metrics (insight)
```

At each stage the system **adds metrics** — it never overwrites. A metric records its `origin` (`parser`, `dialect`, `compiler`, `runtime`, `user`, `analyzed`), and a precedence rule decides which one is shown. That single idea lets the app overlay the **planned** target, the **tracked** actual, and the **analyzed** projection in one view. See [`docs/architecture/metric-lifecycle.md`](./docs/architecture/metric-lifecycle.md).

## Using the playground

The home tour starts workouts only when Run is pressed. Each run saves a fresh playground note, and Stop, completion, or leaving the timer saves its results once. Home analytics uses labelled, in-memory example data without adding sessions to your journal; select This run to inspect the current note's results. Desktop, mobile, and reduced-motion layouts share the same run and analytics behavior.

Journal, Collections, Playgrounds, Efforts, and Sessions share an icon ribbon and a filter panel. On mobile, open navigation to use the same ribbon beside the panel. Filter accordions show values supported by the current WQL results; selecting or removing a condition updates `?q=` and refreshes the available filters and result groups. Each selection adds a history entry, so browser Back restores the previous query. Selected conditions remain removable when no results match.

Each filter value has one button that cycles Off, Include, and Exclude. Expanded sections share one scroll container; the section header stays sticky so it can be collapsed while scrolling a long list. Edit `apps/playground/app/nav/panels/conditionsConfig.ts` to configure section labels, ordering, visibility, and expected values. Expected values constrain and label current-result choices; active selections stay visible even when no results match. During query execution, the previous rows remain visible with controls disabled until the new results arrive.

The mobile drawer fills the screen width. Selecting an L1 destination keeps it open for L2 filtering. Filters update immediately; Apply closes the drawer. Full-query shortcuts such as All and Feeds navigate and close it immediately.

Result-identity catalogs are hidden from their own library filters. Supported section headers have a Group checkbox that adds or removes that dimension from the current WQL. Save the query from its toolbar or the Custom navigation item with a label and icon; manage these shortcuts in Settings > Query Defaults. Unmatched queries select Custom above New shortcut. Equivalent queries select the same shortcut regardless of filter or grouping order.

## The `wod` block syntax

A workout is plain Markdown; WOD Wiki interprets fenced ` ```time ` (and ` ```log `) blocks. Each line is a statement of `[lap] fragment fragment …`, and **indentation creates hierarchy**.

````markdown
## WOD

```time
(10) :60 EMOM      ← 10 intervals of 60 seconds (Every Minute On the Minute)
  + 2 Burpees      ← composed set performed each interval
  + 5 Push Ups
  + 7 Air Squats
```
````

### Fragments at a glance

| You write | It means |
|---|---|
| `5:00`, `1:00`, `:60`, `:30` | **Duration** — a planned timer |
| `(3)`, `(10)` | **Rounds** — repeat the child block N times |
| `(21-15-9)`, `(100-80-60-40-20)` | **Rep ladder** — a sequence of round sizes |
| `10`, `50` | **Reps** for the effort on the line |
| `400m`, `1000m`, `0.5mile` | **Distance** (units: `m`, `km`, `ft`, `mile`) |
| `16kg`, `225lb`, `bw` | **Load** (units: `kg`, `lb`, `bw` = bodyweight) |
| `Burpees`, `KB Deadlift` | **Effort** — the movement name |
| `?` | an athlete-chosen value to fill in (`10:00 ? KB Snatch 16kg`) |
| `:?` | a **collectible** timer (value recorded, not counted down) |
| `+` / `-` | **lap** markers (compose / superset siblings) |
| `@` | binds a quantity as resistance |
| `*` | a **rest** marker (Tabata-style) |
| `// note` | a comment |

### A few real shapes

```time
(3)                        # 3 rounds of…
  10 Air Squats
  10 Push Ups

10:00 AMRAP                # as many rounds as possible in 10:00
  5 Pull Ups
  10 Push Ups
  15 Air Squats

(8) Power Sprints          # 8 rounds: sprint then rest
  25m Freestyle Sprint
  1:30 Rest

(5)                        # 5×8 kettlebell deadlifts @16kg
  8 KB Deadlift 16kg
  :30 Rest
```

Dialects recognize keywords like `EMOM`, `AMRAP`, `FOR TIME`, `TABATA`, `STRENGTH`, `RUN/ROW/BIKE/SWIM` and tag blocks accordingly.

## The Plan → Track → Analyze workflow

The app is a continuous loop. The same metric flows through every phase.

### 1. PLAN — author & choose the work
- **Editor** (`/notes/:noteId`, `/playground/:id`) — write Markdown + `wod` blocks with live syntax checking, suggestions, and typed frontmatter tags.
- **Collections** (`/collections`) — browse workout libraries; pick one to run.
- **Efforts** (`/efforts`, `/effort/:slug`) — exercise definitions (MET, discipline, intensity tier) that power analytics and autocomplete.
- **Feeds** (`/feeds`) — date-indexed streams of workouts.

### 2. TRACK — execute on the clock
- **Clock / Run** (`/run/:runtimeId`) — JIT-compiled blocks run on the runtime clock: timers count, rounds advance, sound cues fire, and you log actual reps/load/RPE. Each segment emits statements recorded directly as `EventRecord` rows.

### 3. ANALYZE — review & derive insight
- **Review** (`/review/:runtimeId`, `/sessions/:sessionId`) — per-segment results + derived analytics.
- **Journal** (`/journal`, `/journal/:date`) — long-term training log grouped by date pages.
- **Dashboards** (`/dashboard`, `/dashboard/:slug`) — custom widgets and Datadog-style WQL queries (`<agg>:<metric>{filters} by {dim}`).

Details: [`docs/app/screens-and-workflow.md`](./docs/app/screens-and-workflow.md), [`docs/language/wql-reference.md`](./docs/language/wql-reference.md), and [WQL query composition](./docs/prototypes/WQL-Domain-Query-Composition.md).

### Deployed E2E verification

Run the production bundle locally with `bun run build:app` followed by
`E2E_TARGET=preview bun run test:e2e`. Set `E2E_APP_URL` to test a deployed build
without starting a local server. Seed-dependent tests await the bootstrap's
`data-seed-state` and `data-seed-outcome` on `<html>` before checking the route.
Derived seed rows are queued within the existing atomic chunk transaction;
a failed write rolls back both rows and the checkpoint.
Canvas commits before any library fetch; the remaining chunks fetch four at a
time and still commit in manifest order. Failed fetches preserve the committed
checkpoint so the next bootstrap resumes without reapplying completed chunks.
Playwright's pinned Chromium uses SQLite-backed IndexedDB explicitly; its
LevelDB backend took 31.5 seconds for a fresh seed versus 2.8 seconds with SQLite.

PR previews and main run the live-app suite after deployment and wait for the
deployed entry-bundle hash. Reports publish to `https://<branch-slug>.e2e.wod.wiki/`
and [the main report](https://e2e.wod.wiki/), including failed runs. CI summaries
show per-file pass, fail, flaky, and skipped counts. `e2e-run-metadata.json` beside
the report records the tested commit, build hash, deploy URL, timestamp, and run URL.
Failed-test artifacts retain the initial trace, browser console, network, and video.

Quarantines must cite an open issue: unsupported effort actions and the CI
performance budget are tracked in [#719](https://github.com/SergeiGolos/wod-wiki/issues/719);
production Chromecast round-trips in [#1067](https://github.com/SergeiGolos/wod-wiki/issues/1067);
storage-denial bootstrap recovery in [#1068](https://github.com/SergeiGolos/wod-wiki/issues/1068).
Retired routes and widgets are removed from the suite rather than silently skipped.
