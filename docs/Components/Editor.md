The Editor component is a central part of wod.wiki that provides an interactive interface for creating and editing workouts using the specialized [wod.wiki syntax](../Core/Compile.md) that is executed by the [Runtime](../Core/Runtime.md) component.

## Core Features

The Editor offers several key features that enhance the workout creation experience:

### Monaco-Based Code Editor

- Built on Monaco Editor (the same engine that powers VS Code)
- Customized for wod.wiki's specialized workout syntax
- Provides an intuitive text editing experience for workout definitions

### Syntax Highlighting

The editor implements custom syntax highlighting for different workout elements defined in the [Compile](../Core/Compile.md) documentation:

| Element Type | Color/Style | Icon Hint |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Duration | Orange, Bold | ‚è±Ô∏è (before) |
| Repetitions | Green, Bold | x (after) |
| Resistance/Weight | Green, Bold | üí™ (before) |
| Distance | Green | None |
| Effort | Black | None |
| Rounds | Brown | :rounds (after) |

### Intelligent Assistance

- **Auto-completion**: Suggests common workout patterns and exercises
- **Inlay Hints**: Provides visual cues for different workout elements
- **Real-time Validation**: Validates workout syntax as you type
- **Live Parsing**: Continuously parses the workout definition into a structured format

## Architecture

The Editor component is composed of several interconnected parts:

### Component Structure

```
EditorContainer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ButtonRibbon (controls)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimerDisplay (workout visualization)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WodWiki (core editor)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ResultsDisplay (metrics and analysis)
```

### Key Classes

1. **WodWikiSyntaxInitializer**: Configures the Monaco editor with custom syntax highlighting, themes, and behavior
2. **SemantcTokenEngine**: Handles tokenization and syntax highlighting
3. **SuggestionEngine**: Provides intelligent code completion
4. **useTimerRuntime**: React hook that manages the runtime state and execution

## Integration with Runtime

The Editor maintains a bidirectional relationship with the [Runtime](../Core/Runtime.md) component:

1. When text is edited, it's parsed into a structured `WodRuntimeScript` using the compilation process described in the [Compile](../Core/Compile.md) documentation
2. The script is passed to the runtime for execution
3. Runtime results are displayed in the editor interface
4. Controls allow starting, stopping, and manipulating the workout execution

For detailed information about how the workout scripts are executed, see the [Runtime](../Core/Runtime.md) documentation.

## User Interface

The Editor UI is designed to be clean and intuitive:

- **Top Section**: Controls and timer display
- **Middle Section**: Text editing area with syntax highlighting
- **Bottom Section**: Results display showing metrics and analytics

## Technical Implementation

The Editor is implemented using React and TypeScript with the following technical characteristics:

- Monaco Editor integration via `@monaco-editor/react`
- Custom language definition for wod.wiki syntax (see [Compile](../Core/Compile.md))
- React hooks for state management
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Real-time parsing and validation

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Editor component include:

- Enhanced autocompletion with exercise database integration
- Visual workout builder complementing the text editor
- Export functionality to various formats
- Collaborative editing features

This Editor component serves as the primary interface between users and the wod.wiki platform, enabling efficient creation and manipulation of structured workout definitions in a human-readable format.
