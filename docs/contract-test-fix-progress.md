# Contract Test Fix Summary for 011-runtime-block-implementation
# Date: 2025-10-09
# Status: In Progress

## Problem
Contract test files contain TDD placeholder wrappers `expect(() => {...}).toThrow()` that were never updated after implementations were completed. This causes all tests to fail even though implementations exist.

## Files Requiring Fixes
1. ✅ RoundsBehavior.contract.test.ts (PARTIALLY FIXED - Constructor, onPush, onNext sections done)
2. ❌ RoundsBlock.contract.test.ts (NOT STARTED)
3. ❌ TimerBlock.contract.test.ts (NOT STARTED)
4. ❌ EffortBlock.contract.test.ts (NOT STARTED)

## Fix Pattern
Before:
```typescript
it('test name', () => {
  expect(() => {
    const obj = new Constructor();
    expect(obj.method()).toBe(value);
  }).toThrow();
});
```

After:
```typescript
it('test name', () => {
  const obj = new Constructor();
  expect(obj.method()).toBe(value);
});
```

## Sections Completed in RoundsBehavior.contract.test.ts
- ✅ Constructor tests (6 tests)
- ✅ onPush() tests (2 tests)
- ✅ onNext() tests (3 tests)

## Sections Remaining in RoundsBehavior.contract.test.ts
- ❌ Rounds Completion (2 tests)
- ❌ Compilation Context (4 tests)
- ❌ AMRAP Support (2 tests)
- ❌ Disposal (1 test)

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining RoundsBehavior sections
2. Apply same pattern to RoundsBlock, TimerBlock, EffortBlock
3. Run `npm run test:unit` to verify fixes
4. Mark tasks T006, T008, T009, T010 as complete in tasks.md
5. Continue with remaining implementation tasks (T012-T051)

## Estimated Time
- RoundsBehavior completion: 10 minutes
- RoundsBlock fixes: 20 minutes
- TimerBlock fixes: 20 minutes
- EffortBlock fixes: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~65 minutes of methodical editing

## Alternative Approach
Create a Node.js script to programmatically parse and fix all files using AST transformation (ts-morph library), but this adds complexity for what is essentially find-replace operations.
