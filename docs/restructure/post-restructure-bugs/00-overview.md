## Audit Results (2026-02-16)

### Story 4 — Round Tracking: **FIXED** ✅

All three sub-bugs resolved:
- **Bug A** (`allChildrenCompleted` always false): `dispatchedOnLastNext` is now reset to `false` at the top of `onNext()`. In the completion branch, `dispatchNext()` is never called, so the flag stays `false` and the getter correctly returns `true`.
- **Bug B** (`shouldLoop` off-by-one): Changed from `round.current <= round.total` to `round.current < round.total`.
- **Bug C** (behavior ordering): `ReEntryBehavior.onNext()` is now a no-op. Round advancement moved entirely into `ChildSelectionBehavior.advanceRound()`, eliminating the cross-behavior ordering dependency.

### Story 5 — Timer Completion: **FIXED** ✅

All conditions resolved:
- `ChildSelectionBehavior.onNext()` now has an `isComplete` guard at the very top, preventing child dispatch after timer expiry.
- `shouldLoop()` also checks `ctx.block.isComplete` (belt-and-suspenders).
- `CompletedBlockPopBehavior` is now added **unconditionally** to all container blocks by `ChildrenStrategy`, removing the fragile dependency on `hasBehavior(TimerEndingBehavior)`.

### Story 3 — Duration NaN: **MOSTLY FIXED** ⚠️

The review grid display bug is fixed:
- `formatDuration()` in both `GridRow.tsx` and `useGridData.ts` now guards `ms === undefined || isNaN(ms)`.
- Duration computation in `useGridData.ts` uses `typeof === 'number' && !isNaN(...)` instead of nullish coalescing.

Remaining minor gaps:
- `AnalyticsTransformer.ts` still has no NaN guard on `output.elapsed / 1000` (mitigated by downstream guards).
- `calculateElapsed.ts` has a `formatDuration()` that still has **no NaN guard** — can produce `"NaN:NaN"` in fragment images outside the review grid.

### Story 2 — Double-Write: **STILL OPEN** 🔴

Both writers are fully intact:
- `TimerBehavior.onUnmount()` still calls `appendResultFragments()` (append semantics).
- `ReportOutputBehavior.onUnmount()` still independently calls `computeTimerResults()` + `writeResultMemory()` (replace semantics).
- Current behavior ordering (Timer first → Report second) masks the duplicate because Report's replace overwrites Timer's append.
- The structural bug remains — two behaviors independently compute and write the same data; outcome depends entirely on insertion order.
- `ReportOutputBehavior` test `computes timer results and emits completion output on unmount` is **failing** (1 test failure).

### Story 1 — Timer Column: **STILL OPEN** 🔴

None of the three conditions have been addressed:
- `FragmentType.Timer` still listed in `ALL_FRAGMENT_COLUMNS`, `DEFAULT_VISIBLE_COLUMNS`, and `isNumericFragmentType()` in `gridPresets.ts`.
- `FragmentType.Timer` still in `FRAGMENT_GRAPH_COLORS` and `getUnitForColumn()` in `useGraphData.ts`.
- `ReportOutputBehavior.collectStateFragments()` still includes `'timer'` memory tag fragments in state output.

### Promotion / Inheritance System: **WORKING** ✅

The promotion/inheritance system itself is correctly implemented and fully tested (36 tests passing):
- `FragmentPromotionBehavior` writes promoted fragments to `fragment:promote` and `fragment:rep-target`.
- `JitCompiler.compile()` reads promoted fragments via `getFragmentMemoryByVisibility('promote')` and injects them into child statement nodes.
- Origin-based precedence (`compiler` > `parser` > `execution`) works correctly.
- `ChildSelectionBehavior.advanceRound()` refreshes promotion memory on round change.

The promotion system was **not broken**. The prior perception of breakage was likely caused by **Story 4's round-tracking bugs** (now fixed), which prevented the round counter from advancing — making it appear that promotion wasn't propagating updated values.

### NEW — Story 6: EMOM Span History Erasure (**HIGH**)

`TimerEndingBehavior.resetIntervalState()` **replaces all spans** with a single new span on each EMOM interval reset:
```typescript
spans: [new TimeSpan(now)]  // ALL previous spans ERASED
```
For an EMOM with 10 intervals, `computeTimerResults()` on final unmount sees only the **last interval's** span. Result: `elapsed` = last interval duration only (e.g., 60s instead of 600s), `spans` contains 1 entry instead of 10.

**Affected**: All EMOM/interval blocks compiled by `IntervalLogicStrategy`.

### NEW — Story 7: Loop Blocks Report elapsed=0, total=0 (**MEDIUM**)

`GenericLoopStrategy` adds `ReportOutputBehavior` but **no** `TimerBehavior`. When `ReportOutputBehavior.computeTimerResults()` runs and finds no `'timer'` memory, it falls to the no-timer fallback:
```typescript
new ElapsedFragment(0, blockKey, now)   // always 0
new TotalFragment(0, blockKey, now)     // always 0
```
A 3-round loop running for 5 minutes reports elapsed=0, total=0.

**Affected**: Rounds-based blocks (e.g., `"3 Rounds"`) compiled by `GenericLoopStrategy`.

## Recommended Fix Order (Updated)

1. **[Story 6](story-6-emom-span-erasure.md)** (EMOM span erasure) — **HIGH** — timer values critically wrong for all EMOM blocks
2. **[Story 2](story-2-elapsed-total-double-write.md)** (Double-write) — **MEDIUM** — structural cleanup; unify timer result ownership in `ReportOutputBehavior` only; remove `appendResultFragments` from `TimerBehavior`
3. **[Story 7](story-7-loop-elapsed-zero.md)** (Loop elapsed=0) — **MEDIUM** — loop blocks need wall-clock elapsed tracking even without a timer
4. **[Story 1](story-1-remove-timer-column.md)** (Timer column) — **LOW** — cosmetic grid cleanup
5. ~~**[Story 4](story-4-round-tracking.md)**~~ — **FIXED**
6. ~~**[Story 5](story-5-timer-completion.md)**~~ — **FIXED**
7. ~~**[Story 3](story-3-duration-nan.md)**~~ — **MOSTLY FIXED** (residual gap in runtime `formatDuration`)

## Dependency Graph (Updated)

```
Story 6 (EMOM span erasure) — independent, highest priority
    │
Story 2 (Double-write cleanup)
    │
    └── Story 7 (Loop elapsed=0) — benefits from unified timer-result ownership

Story 1 (Timer column) — independent

Story 3 (Duration NaN) — residual gap in calculateElapsed.ts formatDuration()

Story 4 (Round tracking) — FIXED
Story 5 (Timer completion) — FIXED
```
