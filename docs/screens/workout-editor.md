## 4. Composable Behaviors

- **Seed Protection vs User Scratch:**
  - Bundled workouts display in read-only mode by default.
  - Tapping Edit or modifying content creates a personal scratch copy without mutating seed assets.
- **Direct Scheduling Flow:**
  - Scheduling creates an authoritative `Note` row attached to the target `Page.date`.
  - Toast alert provides direct navigation link via `noteByIdPath(journalNote.id)`.
