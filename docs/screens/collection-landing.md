## 2. Desktop View Layout (≥1024px)

- **Split Pane Presentation:**
  - **Left Prose Pane (60% width):** Narrative description, difficulty badge, category chips, and embedded workouts list with instant search filter.
  - **Right Interactive Pane (40% width):** Sticky interactive CodeMirror preview showing the currently selected workout's raw Whiteboard script.
- **Header:** Sticky collection title bar with "Start Workout" and "Add to Today" buttons.
- **TOC Rail:** Chapter and section links tracking scroll progress through the collection.

## 3. Mobile View Layout (<1024px)

- **Stacked Layout:** Split pane collapses to a single vertical scroll stream.
- **Prose First:** Description and README appear at the top, followed by a filterable workout list.
- **Modal Preview:** Tapping a workout opens the interactive preview and runnable controls in a bottom sheet rather than a side pane.
- **Thumb Dock:** Primary FAB launches the featured or first workout in the collection.

## 4. Composable Behaviors

- **Dynamic Content Ownership:**
  - Clicking any workout item updates the CodeMirror editor pane without full-page navigation.
  - The right pane reflects the active workout's live state, while URL updates to reflect the active selection.
