## 1. Component & Service Dependencies

### Core UI Components
- `JournalPageShell` (`apps/playground/src/panels/page-shells/JournalPageShell.tsx`). Encloses the stacked day entries.
- `StickyPageHeader` (`apps/playground/src/panels/page-shells/StickyPageHeader.tsx`). Renders the date title and day-level action controls.
- `NoteEditor` (`apps/playground/src/components/organisms/editor/NoteEditor.tsx`). Instantiated per note on the date.
- `FullscreenTimer` (`apps/playground/src/components/organisms/review/FullscreenTimer.tsx`). Launches modal timer when `?autoStart=` is present.
- `ResponsiveActions` (`apps/playground/app/nav/ResponsiveActions.tsx`). Synchronizes multi-note actions across breakpoints.

### Services, Providers, & Stores
- `IndexedDBContentProvider` (`apps/playground/src/services/content/IndexedDBContentProvider.ts`). Queries all notes associated with the target `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `journalNotes` (`apps/playground/app/services/journalNotes.ts`). Direct persistence service for inline content changes.
- `WorkbenchSessionProvider` (`apps/playground/src/stores/workbenchSessionStore.ts`). Scopes active workout and execution event logging.
- `pendingRuntimes` (`apps/playground/app/runtimeStore.ts`). Stores active timer blocks.

### Hooks & Utilities

## 4. Composable Behaviors

- **Multi-Note Boundary Isolation:**
  - Each note in the stack retains independent CodeMirror instances.
  - Edits in one note commit strictly to that note's `noteId` and versioned `NoteSegment` rows.
  - Text slicing across note boundaries is prohibited.
- **Auto-Start Handlers:**
  - Deep links containing `?autoStart=<runtimeId>` extract the pending block and mount `FullscreenTimer` overlay immediately.
  - On completion, the result statement appends to the selected note via `resolveCompletionTargets`.
