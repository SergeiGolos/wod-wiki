## 4. Composable Behaviors

- **Dual-Link Generation:**
  - Clicking a collection card routes to `/c/:slug` (the specialized landing view).
  - Clicking an individual workout row inside a collection routes directly to `/c/:collection/:workout` or `/notes/:noteId` if a user copy exists.
- **Responsive Facets:**
  - Desktop renders tag facets in the right rail.
  - Mobile places facet filters inside the drawer and bottom sheet filter dialog.
