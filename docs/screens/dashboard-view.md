## 4. Composable Behaviors

- **Note-Backed Dashboards:**
  - Dashboards are authored markdown notes containing `dashboard: true` and ````query```` fences.
  - Adding or modifying a widget updates the note's underlying segments without introducing separate database tables.
- **Parallel Query Execution:**
  - `DashboardView` dispatches each widget's query concurrently to `queryService`.
  - Empty or invalid widgets show discrete error cards without crashing the dashboard grid.
