| 🟢 **Visualization Tools** | Excellent | 90% | Minor features missing |

**Legend**: 🟢 Good | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Critical Gap

## What Works Today

✅ Parse any workout syntax → CodeStatement tree  
✅ Match strategy based on fragments  
✅ Compile block with behaviors  
✅ Push block to runtime stack  
✅ Visualize compilation process in Storybook  
✅ Allocate memory for timer state  
✅ Display static timer values  
✅ All behavior tests passing (61/61)  
✅ All strategy tests passing (27/27)  

---

## What's Broken/Missing

❌ **No actual timer countdown during execution**  
❌ **Blocks never "complete" or signal "done"**  
❌ **Clock UI doesn't update from runtime state**  
❌ **Can't record workout results**  
❌ **Can't track reps/rounds during workout**  
❌ **90 test failures** (test infrastructure issue)  

---

## Critical Path to MVP

### Week 1-2: Make Something Execute
**Goal**: Timer counts down and displays in UI

1. Fix test mocks (2-4 hours)
2. Create `TimerBlock` class with countdown logic (3 days)
3. Add timer tick events (2 days)
4. Connect runtime memory to `TimeDisplay` (2 days)
5. Add start/stop controls (1 day)

**Deliverable**: "30 second countdown timer" works end-to-end

---

### Week 3-4: Add Workout Types
**Goal**: AMRAP workouts execute fully

1. Create `RoundsBlock` for round tracking (3 days)
2. Create `EffortBlock` for exercise display (2 days)
3. Implement block completion detection (2 days)
4. Test "Cindy" workout (20:00 AMRAP) (3 days)

**Deliverable**: "Cindy" benchmark workout executes with live timer

---

### Week 5-6: Record Results
**Goal**: Save and view workout history

1. Build `WorkoutResult` data model (1 day)
2. Add result recording on completion (2 days)
3. Add rep count input during workout (2 days)
4. Display workout history list (3 days)
5. LocalStorage persistence (2 days)

**Deliverable**: Complete a workout and see it in your history

## Test Status Summary

| Test Suite | Passing | Failing | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Behaviors** | 61 | 0 | 🟢 Perfect |
| **Strategies** | 27 | 0 | 🟢 Perfect |
| **JIT Compiler** | 18 | 0 | 🟢 Perfect |
| **Memory System** | 14 | 0 | 🟢 Perfect |
| **RuntimeStack** | 4 | 86 | 🔴 Mock issue |
| **Parser** | 13 | 4 | 🟡 Minor issues |
| **Total** | **334** | **90** | 🟡 78% pass rate |

**Note**: Most failures are due to test infrastructure (mock blocks missing `sourceIds`), not actual implementation bugs.

## Architecture Strengths

### ✅ What's Done Well

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Clean, extensible compilation
2. **Behavior Composition**: Avoids inheritance hell
3. **Memory System**: Type-safe state management
4. **Parser**: Handles complex workout syntax
5. **Visualization**: Excellent developer experience

---

## Architecture Gaps

### ❌ What's Missing

1. **Concrete Block Types**: Only generic `RuntimeBlock` exists
2. **Execution Logic**: Blocks don't know how to "run"
3. **Completion Detection**: No way to know when workout is "done"
4. **UI Integration**: Runtime state not connected to display
5. **Recording Layer**: No persistence of workout results

---

## Technology Choices Working Well

- ✅ **TypeScript**: Strong typing catching errors
- ✅ **React**: Component model fits UI needs
- ✅ **Vitest**: Fast test execution
- ✅ **Storybook**: Excellent for visualization
- ✅ **Monaco Editor**: Professional code editing
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development

## Recommended Focus Areas

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
1. 🔥 **Fix test infrastructure** - restore confidence
2. 🔥 **Implement TimerBlock** - prove execution model
3. 🔥 **Connect timer to UI** - show visible progress

### Short Term (Week 3-6)
4. 🔥 **Add RoundsBlock & EffortBlock** - support AMRAP
5. 🔥 **Implement recording** - deliver user value
6. 🟡 Add pause/resume controls

### Medium Term (Week 7-12)
7. 🟡 Add workout library UI
8. 🟡 Mobile optimization
9. 🟡 Audio cues integration
10. 🟡 Advanced strategies (EMOM, Tabata)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Runtime execution model wrong** | Low | High | Behavior tests prove model works |
| **UI integration complex** | Medium | Medium | Memory system already designed for this |
| **Recording too ambitious** | Low | Medium | LocalStorage is simple, sufficient for v1 |
| **Timeline too aggressive** | Medium | Low | Can ship without all workout types |
| **Test debt accumulates** | High | Medium | Fix infrastructure issues first |

## Definition of Done for MVP

An MVP is complete when:

1. ✅ User can select a workout (e.g., "Cindy")
2. ✅ User can start the workout
3. ✅ Timer counts down in real-time
4. ✅ User can input reps as they complete exercises
5. ✅ Workout automatically completes when timer expires
6. ✅ Results are saved with timestamp
7. ✅ User can view past workout history
8. ✅ Works on mobile browser (responsive)

**Not Required for MVP**:
- ❌ Pause/resume (nice-to-have)
- ❌ Custom workout creation (v2 feature)
- ❌ Server sync (LocalStorage sufficient)
- ❌ All workout types (start with AMRAP)
