# Wod.Wiki Runtime Internals: Actions, Blocks, and Fragment Composition

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a deep dive into the Wod.Wiki runtime engine, building upon the general application architecture outlined in `2025-05-17.ApplicationArchitectureDeepDive.md`. The focus here is on the internal mechanics: how workout script fragments are processed, how executable blocks are formed and managed, and how actions drive the workout execution.

### 1.2 Core Runtime Loop

The runtime operates on an event-driven basis. An "event" can be the initial start of a workout, the completion of a timer, a user interaction (like pressing "next" or "stop"), or an internal signal from a block. In response to an event, the current block on the `RuntimeStack` typically has its `next()` (or `enter()`/`leave()`) method called. This method evaluates the block's state and the nature of the event, then generates one or more `IRuntimeAction`s. These actions are processed by the runtime, leading to state changes, UI updates, and potentially new events.

## 2 From User Input to Runtime Primitives: The Journey of a Fragment

### 2.1 Recap of Parsing

As detailed in the main architecture document, user input goes through:

1. Lexer: Text -> Tokens (e.g., `TIME_TOKEN`, `EFFORT_TOKEN`, `NUMBER_TOKEN`).
2. Parser: Tokens -> `StatementNode`s (hierarchical structure). Each `StatementNode` contains an array of `Fragment`s.
3. Interpreter/Visitor: `StatementNode`s -> `PrecompiledNode`s. `PrecompiledNode`s are enriched versions of `StatementNode`s, also containing `Fragment`s, and serve as the direct input to the runtime JIT compiler.

### 2.2 Fragments: The Atomic Units of Information

Fragments are the smallest meaningful pieces of data parsed from the workout script. They represent specific details about an exercise, a timer, or a structural element. Each fragment type plays a distinct role in defining the behavior and content of runtime blocks.

#### `TimerFragment`

Represents a time duration for various timed blocks (e.g., countdown, stopwatch, intervals).

- Properties:
  - `image: string`: The raw string representation of the time (e.g., "01:30", "10:00:00").
  - `days: number`, `hours: number`, `minutes: number`, `seconds: number`: Parsed time components.
  - `original: number`: Total duration in milliseconds, used for precise time calculations by the runtime.
  - `isIncrement: boolean`: Indicates if the timer is intended to count up (true) or down (false, default). This is often determined in conjunction with an `IncrementFragment`.
  - `type: "timer"`

- Runtime Usage:
  The runtime uses `TimerFragment`s to initialize and manage timers. For instance, a `CountdownBlock` would use the `original` value to set its duration and count down to zero. The `isIncrement` flag helps determine if the display should show time elapsing or time remaining.

#### `EffortFragment`

Defines the name or description of an activity or exercise.

- Properties:
  - `effort: string`: The name of the effort (e.g., "Push-ups", "Run", "Rest").
  - `type: "effort"`

- Runtime Usage:
  The runtime displays the `effort` string to the user, indicating the current or upcoming activity. It's essential for guiding the user through the workout sequence.

#### `RepFragment`

Specifies the number of repetitions for an exercise.

- Properties:
  - `reps?: number`: The count of repetitions (optional).
  - `type: "rep"`

- Runtime Usage:
  Associated with an `EffortFragment`, the runtime uses `RepFragment`s to inform the user of the target repetition count. This might be displayed alongside the effort name.

#### `DistanceFragment`

Represents a distance to be covered for activities like running, rowing, or swimming.

- Properties:
  - `value: string`: The numerical value of the distance (e.g., "100", "1.5").
  - `units: string`: The unit of measurement (e.g., "m", "km", "ft", "mi").
  - `type: "distance"`

- Runtime Usage:
  The runtime displays the target distance and units. For interactive workouts, this could be linked to tracking progress.

#### `ResistanceFragment`

Specifies a weight or resistance level for strength-based exercises.

- Properties:
  - `value: string`: The numerical value of the resistance (e.g., "20", "95.5").
  - `units: string`: The unit of measurement (e.g., "kg", "lbs").
  - `type: "resistance"`

- Runtime Usage:
  Displayed alongside the associated `EffortFragment` and `RepFragment` to provide complete details for an exercise set (e.g., "Squats: 3x10 @ 100kg").

#### `RoundsFragment`

Defines the number of rounds for a set of activities or a circuit.

- Properties:
  - `count: number`: The number of rounds.
  - `type: "rounds"`

- Runtime Usage:
  The runtime uses this to control looping behavior for blocks like AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) or multi-round "For Time" blocks. It dictates how many times a sequence of child blocks should be executed.

#### `ActionFragment`

Represents a command or action to be performed by the runtime, often triggered by user interaction or specific workout syntax.

- Properties:
  - `action: string`: The name of the action (e.g., "start", "pause", "next", "stop", "reset").
  - `type: "action"`

- Runtime Usage:
  These fragments allow the script to define control flow. For example, a "next" action could advance to the subsequent block in a workout sequence, or a "start" action could initiate a timer.

#### `TextFragment`

Contains arbitrary text, often for display, instructions, or notes within the workout.

- Properties:
  - `text: string`: The content of the text.
  - `level?: string`: Optional formatting hint (e.g., "h1", "h2", "p", "note") that the UI can use for styling.
  - `type: "text"`

- Runtime Usage:
  The runtime displays this text to the user. It can be used for workout titles, section headings, instructional cues, or motivational messages.

#### `IncrementFragment`

Modifies the behavior of a timer, typically indicating whether it should count up (stopwatch) or count down.

- Properties:
  - `image: string`: The character representing the increment direction (e.g., "^", "v").
  - `increment: number`: Parsed value, `1` for count-up (e.g., from "^") or `-1` for count-down (e.g., from "v").
  - `type: "increment"`

- Runtime Usage:
  This fragment works in conjunction with a `TimerFragment`. If an `IncrementFragment` with `increment: 1` is present, the associated timer will count up. If `increment: -1`, it will count down. If absent, a default behavior (e.g., countdown) might be assumed by the timer block.

#### `LapFragment`

Marks a lap or a segment within a workout structure, often used in timed intervals or rounds.

- Properties:
  - `group: GroupType`: The type of group this lap belongs to (e.g., 'emom', 'tabata', 'section'), allowing for context-specific lap handling.
  - `image: string`: The raw text representing the lap marker (e.g., "Lap", or a custom marker).
  - `type: "lap"`

- Runtime Usage:
  When the runtime encounters a `LapFragment`, it can trigger actions like recording a lap time, advancing to the next interval in a series (like in Tabata or EMOM blocks), or providing a visual cue to the user.

---

- Role: They are stored within `PrecompiledNode`s. During runtime, `RuntimeBlock`s and `IRuntimeBlockStrategy`s use **Block Readers** to extract and interpret these fragments to understand what the block should do or how it should be configured. For example, an `EffortFragment` provides the name of an exercise, while `RepFragment` and `ResistanceFragment` provide the repetition count and weight for that exercise.

## 3 Runtime Blocks (`IRuntimeBlock`): The Building Blocks of Execution

`RuntimeBlock`s are the primary components that execute the workout logic. Each block type is responsible for a specific kind of workout segment (e.g., an exercise, a timer, a repeating set of rounds).

### 3.1 The `IRuntimeBlock` Interface

Defines the fundamental contract for all executable blocks within the runtime. Key aspects include methods for lifecycle management (`enter`, `next`, `leave`), accessing block-specific context (`getContext`), and retrieving metrics (`getMetrics`).

### 3.2 `RuntimeBlock` (formerly `AbstractBlockLifecycle`)

Found in `src/core/runtime/blocks/RuntimeBlock.ts`, this is the abstract base class for all runtime blocks, implementing the **Template Method pattern**.

- Lifecycle Methods (Template Methods):
  - `enter(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Called when the block is pushed onto the `RuntimeStack` and becomes active. It typically calls `this.onEnter()`.
  - `next(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Called by the runtime to advance the block. This could be due to a timer tick, user action (like completing an effort), or a child block popping. It typically calls `this.onNext()`.
  - `leave(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Called when the block is being popped from the `RuntimeStack`. It typically calls `this.onLeave()`.
- Hook Methods (Abstract, to be implemented by subclasses):
  - `protected onEnter(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Contains the specific logic for when this block type enters.
  - `protected onNext(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Contains the specific logic for how this block type advances or responds to events.
  - `protected onLeave(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]`: Contains the specific logic for when this block type leaves.
- State Management: Utilizes `BlockContext` to store and manage its instance-specific state, including `ResultSpan`s for metrics.

### 3.3 `BlockContext`: Per-Instance State and Metrics

Each instance of a `RuntimeBlock` has an associated `BlockContext`.

- Purpose: Manages the dynamic state of that specific block instance during execution.

- Contents:
  - `TimeSpan`s: Tracks active periods for the block.
  - `ResultSpan`s: Stores the outcome of the block's execution, including final duration and metrics.
  - `MetricsContext`: Manages the aggregation of `RuntimeMetric`s for the block, considering its relationship with child blocks (ADD, MULTIPLY, INHERIT).
  - Other state: Current repetition count, pointers, flags, etc.

- Fragment Interaction: The `BlockContext` is populated based on data derived from fragments. For example, if a `TimerFragment` indicates a 30-second duration, the `BlockContext` might store this target duration. If `RepFragment`s define 10 reps, the context tracks progress towards these 10 reps.

### 3.4 Deep Dive into Concrete Block Types

(This section would elaborate on how each block uses fragments and generates actions, referencing the specific readers and actions documented previously.)

- `RootBlock`:
  - Fragments Used: Operates on the root `PrecompiledNode`.
  - Logic: Manages the overall sequence of top-level child blocks. Generates `PushStatementAction` to push its first child. Handles overall workout start/end. Aggregates metrics from its children.

- `EffortBlock`:
  - Fragments Used: `EffortFragment` (exercise name), `RepFragment` (reps), `ResistanceFragment` (weight), `DistanceFragment` (distance), `TimerFragment` (if it's a timed effort). Uses `getMetrics` reader.
  - Logic: Represents a single exercise. Manages reps/time. Generates `UpdateMetricsAction` with `RuntimeMetric` built from its fragments. Can generate `StartTimerAction`/`StopTimerAction` if timed.

- `TimerBlock`:
  - Fragments Used: `TimerFragment`, `IncrementFragment` (via `getDuration` reader to determine count-up/down).
  - Logic: Manages a timed interval. Generates `StartTimerAction`. Its `next()` method might be called on timer ticks. Generates `CompleteTimerAction` or `PopBlockAction` when time is up.

- `RepeatingBlock`:
  - Fragments Used: `RoundsFragment` (number of rounds), and processes child `PrecompiledNode`s.
  - Logic: Executes a sequence of child blocks for a specified number of rounds. `BlockContext` tracks current round. Generates `PushStatementAction` for child blocks. When a round completes, it might generate `UpdateMetricsAction` (e.g., "Round X Complete") and then either push the first child of the next round or, if all rounds are done, `PopBlockAction`.

- `TimedGroupBlock` (e.g., AMRAP):
  - Fragments Used: `TimerFragment` (total duration, usually countdown via `getDuration`), and processes child `PrecompiledNode`s.
  - Logic: Manages a group of exercises to be performed repeatedly within a time limit. Generates `StartTimerAction` for the group. Pushes child blocks. When children complete a cycle, it checks if time remains and may loop by re-pushing the first child. Generates `PopBlockAction` when the main timer expires.

- `IdleRuntimeBlock`: Represents a pause. Likely uses a `TimerFragment` if it's a timed rest.

- `DoneRuntimeBlock`: Signals workout completion. Generates final metric aggregation actions.

## 4 Block Readers (`src/core/runtime/blocks/readers/`): Accessing Fragment Data

Readers are utility functions that provide a clean, specific API for `RuntimeBlock`s and `IRuntimeBlockStrategy`s to extract and interpret data from the `Fragment`s within `PrecompiledNode`s.

- Purpose: Decouple blocks/strategies from the raw structure of `PrecompiledNode.fragments`. Make it easier to get specific data types.

- Key Examples:
  - `getDuration(node: StatementNode): IDuration[]`: Crucial for timed blocks. It finds `TimerFragment`s and `IncrementFragment`s in the node to determine not just the time value but also the direction (count-up/down).
  - `getMetrics(node: StatementNode): RuntimeMetric`: Assembles a `RuntimeMetric` object by finding and processing `EffortFragment`, `RepFragment`, `DistanceFragment`, and `ResistanceFragment`s within a node. This is fundamental for tracking performance.
  - `getEffort`, `getRep`, `getResistance`, `getDistance`: Extract arrays of their respective fragment types.
  - `getAction`: Extracts `ActionFragment`s (which might define specific behaviors like playing a sound at a certain point).

## 5 Block Compilation Strategies (`src/core/runtime/blocks/strategies/`): Creating Blocks from Nodes

The `RuntimeJit` (Just-In-Time Compiler) uses the Strategy pattern to decide which type of `IRuntimeBlock` to create for a given `PrecompiledNode` (or an array of them).

- `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` Interface:
  - `canHandle(nodes: PrecompiledNode[]): boolean`: A strategy examines the properties of the input node(s) – often by looking at the types of `Fragment`s they contain (via `PrecompiledNode` helper methods that internally use Readers) or their structural properties (like presence of children or rounds).
  - `compile(nodes: PrecompiledNode[], runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeBlock | undefined`: If `canHandle` is true, this method instantiates and returns the appropriate `RuntimeBlock`, passing the relevant `PrecompiledNode`(s) to its constructor.

- Fragment-Driven Decisions:
  - `BlockEffortStrategy`: `canHandle` checks if a node (without rounds/children) contains `EffortFragment`, `RepFragment`, or `TimerFragment` (duration). If so, it compiles an `EffortBlock`.
  - `BlockTimerStrategy`: `canHandle` looks for a node with only a `TimerFragment` (and no effort/reps/children/rounds). Compiles a `TimerBlock`.
  - `GroupCountdownStrategy`: `canHandle` checks for a node with a countdown `TimerFragment` and children. Compiles a `TimedGroupBlock`.
  - `GroupRepeatingStrategy`: `canHandle` checks for a node with a `RoundsFragment` (count > 1) and children. Compiles a `RepeatingBlock`. It does not appear to differentiate based on the parent node's `LapFragment.groupType` in its `canHandle` method; this differentiation seems to be handled within the `RepeatingBlock` itself or by how it interprets its children's lap fragments.

## 6 Runtime Actions (`src/core/runtime/actions/`): Driving State and Side Effects

`IRuntimeAction`s are commands generated by `RuntimeBlock`s (usually within `onEnter`, `onNext`, or `onLeave`) that instruct the runtime to perform specific operations. They are the primary mechanism for changing state, managing timers, updating metrics, and interacting with the UI.

### 6.1 `IRuntimeAction` Interface

Defines a simple contract, typically an `execute(runtime: ITimerRuntime)` method.

### 6.2 Generation and Purpose

- Origin: Generated by blocks based on their logic and the data from their `PrecompiledNode`s (fragments). For example, if an `EffortBlock` is configured with 10 reps (from a `RepFragment`), after the 10th rep is completed, its `onNext()` might generate a `PopBlockAction`. If it's also timed, its `onEnter()` would generate a `StartTimerAction`.

- `RuntimeStack` Manipulation:
  - `PushStatementAction`: Takes `PrecompiledNode`(s), compiles them (via `RuntimeJit`) into a new `IRuntimeBlock`, and pushes this new block onto the `RuntimeStack`. This is how the workout progresses into new segments or child elements.
  - `PopBlockAction`: Pops the current block from the `RuntimeStack`. Its `leave()` method is called.

- Key Action Categories & Examples:
  - Timer Management:
    - `StartTimerAction`: Initiates timing for the current block's `BlockContext`. Often sets up a system timer if the block is time-sensitive (e.g., `TimerBlock`, `TimedGroupBlock`).
    - `StopTimerAction`: Finalizes timing for the current block's `BlockContext`.
    - `CompleteTimerAction`: A specialized action, often equivalent to `PopBlockAction` for timed blocks.

  - Metric Updates:
    - `UpdateMetricsAction`: Takes a `RuntimeMetric` (often generated by a block based on its fragments and progress) and updates the relevant `ResultSpan` in the `BlockContext`. This action also notifies the UI about the metric update.

  - Flow Control:
    - `GotoEndAction`: Clears the `RuntimeStack` and pushes a `DoneRuntimeBlock`.
    - `ResetAction`: Resets the entire runtime to its initial state.

  - External Interactions:
    - `PlaySoundAction`: Instructs the sound service to play a sound (e.g., start/end beep). The specific sound might come from an `ActionFragment`.
    - `NotifyRuntimeAction`: Pushes an event back into the runtime's input stream (e.g., user manually stopping a timer).

  - UI Directives (often implied or handled by `UpdateMetricsAction` or state changes that the UI observes):
    - `DisplayUpdateAction`: Updates the timer display on the UI.
    - `SetButtonAction`: Changes the state (e.g., enabled/disabled, text) of UI control buttons.
    - `SetResultAction`: Sends updated workout results/metrics to the UI.

### 6.3 Action Processing Loop

The `ITimerRuntime` receives generated actions (often in a queue) and executes them one by one. The execution of an action can lead to:

- Changes in the `RuntimeStack`.
- Updates to `BlockContext` of various blocks.
- Emission of events that the UI layer (via `useTimerRuntime` hook) observes, triggering UI re-renders.
- Further calls to `enter()`, `next()`, or `leave()` methods on blocks, potentially generating more actions.

## 7 Data Flow Example: Fragment to Action

Consider the input: `Push Press 5 reps @60kg

1. Parsing into Fragments:
    - `EffortFragment("Push Press")`
    - `RepFragment(5)`
    - `ResistanceFragment(60, "kg")`

2. `Push Press` Node Processing:
    - Strategy: `BlockEffortStrategy`'s `canHandle` would likely be true (has effort, reps, resistance; no rounds/children initially considered part of *this* block's direct execution, rest is separate).
    - Block Creation: `compile` creates an `EffortBlock` with the "Push Press" `PrecompiledNode`.
    - `EffortBlock.doEnter()`:
        - Might generate `StartTimerAction` if it's also considered a timed effort for metrics, or simply prepare to count reps.
    - `EffortBlock.doNext()` (e.g., on user "next rep" event or if auto-advancing):
        - `BlockContext` increments rep count.
        - If reps < 5: No major action, or UI update for current rep.
        - If reps == 5:
            - Generates `UpdateMetricsAction` with `RuntimeMetric { effort: "Push Press", values: [{type: "repetitions", value: 5}, {type: "resistance", value: 60, unit: "kg"}] }` (built using `getMetrics` reader on its node).
            - Generates `PopBlockAction` (to signify this effort is done).

3. Main `RuntimeStack` processing `PopBlockAction`:
    - `EffortBlock` for "Push Press" is popped. Its `leave()` is called.
    - The runtime then looks at the parent (e.g., `RootBlock` or a `RepeatingBlock`) for what's next. If ":10 rest" was a sibling or next in sequence, the parent block would generate `PushStatementAction` for the ":10 rest" node.

4. `:10 rest` Node Processing:
    - Strategy: `BlockTimerStrategy`'s `canHandle` would be true (has duration, no effort/reps).
    - Block Creation: `compile` creates a `TimerBlock` with the ":10 rest" `PrecompiledNode`.
    - `TimerBlock.doEnter()`:
        - Uses `getDuration` reader to get the 10-second duration.
        - Generates `StartTimerAction`.
        - UI updates to show "Rest 0:10".
    - `TimerBlock.doNext()` (e.g., on system timer tick):
        - `BlockContext` updates remaining time.
        - UI updates timer display.
        - If time_remaining == 0: Generates `CompleteTimerAction` (or `PopBlockAction`).

This flow illustrates the flow from user input to executable behavior and resulting metrics, highlighting the roles of parsing, compilation, and runtime execution using the defined blocks and strategies.

## 8 Conclusion

The Wod.Wiki runtime is a sophisticated engine that translates declarative workout definitions (via fragments) into dynamic, executable behavior. The separation of concerns through Blocks, Actions, Strategies, and Readers allows for a flexible and extensible system. Fragments are the fundamental data carriers, informing every stage of runtime execution from block compilation to action generation and metric tracking. This architecture enables the support of diverse and complex workout structures while maintaining a clear and manageable codebase.
