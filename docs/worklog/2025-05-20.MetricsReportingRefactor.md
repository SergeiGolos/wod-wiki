# Metrics Reporting System Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the Wod.Wiki metrics reporting system to ensure proper metrics collection, accurate TimeSpan tracking, and appropriate aggregation of metrics across different block types. The changes will improve adherence to SOLID principles by clarifying responsibilities: actions will manage TimeSpan creation based on events, while blocks will focus on metrics aggregation and state management during their lifecycle.

## Background

The current implementation shows inconsistencies in how TimeSpans and metrics are managed throughout the runtime system:

1. Some actions like `StartTimerAction` properly manage TimeSpans, while others like `StopTimerAction` don't close TimeSpans correctly
2. Metrics reporting is spread across different actions instead of being centralized in block lifecycle methods
3. The relationship between TimeSpans and metrics isn't clearly implemented
4. Type assertions in `UpdateMetricsAction` suggest architectural issues

## Objectives

1. Ensure all TimeSpans have proper start and stop timestamps
2. Implement a consistent metrics reporting pattern across different block types
3. Move metrics reporting responsibility to `onLeave` methods in block implementations
4. Maintain appropriate metrics relationships (ADD, MULTIPLY, INHERIT) between blocks
5. Eliminate type assertions in metrics-related code
6. Ensure accurate workout metrics in the ResultSpan system

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Action-based TimeSpan Management with RuntimeBlock Enhancements

1.1. Maintain action-based TimeSpan lifecycle management:

- `StartTimerAction`: Creates runtime spans based on start events
- `StopTimerAction`: Creates/closes runtime spans based on stop events
- Actions remain the source of truth for span creation and closure

1.2. Enhance the `RuntimeBlock` template methods to work with action-created TimeSpans:

- `enter()`: Prepare the block for execution but don't create TimeSpans directly
- `onNext()`: Allow blocks to modify their state on tick events
- `leave()`: Process metrics before exiting but don't directly close TimeSpans

1.3. Enhance metrics management in subclasses:

- Each `RuntimeBlock` subclass implements its own metrics aggregation logic directly
- No helper methods on the base `RuntimeBlock` class
- Child implementations handle their specific metrics calculation needs
- No direct TimeSpan creation/closure in any block

### 2. Block Type-Specific Implementations

2.1. EffortBlock:

- Implement `enhanceResultSpan()` to add metrics from source fragments (effort, reps, resistance, distance)
- Use INHERIT relationship type for metrics
- Ensure the `onLeave()` method includes direct metrics processing logic and returns a `WriteResultAction`

2.2. RepeatingBlock:

- Implement `enhanceResultSpan()` with MULTIPLY relationship for rounds
- Create a span for each child that it runs
- Handle different group types appropriately:
  - Compose ('+' operator): Sum metrics from composed children, then multiply by rounds
  - Round-Robin ('-' operator): Sum metrics from each child executed across all rounds
  - Repeat (default): Sum metrics from each child's full execution
- Track and report total rounds completed

2.3. TimedGroupBlock:

- Implement `enhanceResultSpan()` with ADD relationship for child metrics
- Aggregate metrics from all child blocks executed during its time period
- Include total rounds completed if applicable

2.4. RootBlock:

- Implement `enhanceResultSpan()` with ADD relationship for top-level blocks
- Maintain spans for the entire workout duration and for each direct child
- Calculate overall workout statistics
- Provide comprehensive workout summary

### 3. Action System Updates

3.1. StopTimerAction:

- Enhance to properly create/close TimeSpans when stop events occur
- Maintain responsibility for TimeSpan management
- Handle UI updates and state transitions

3.2. StartTimerAction:

- Ensure proper creation of TimeSpans when blocks start
- Maintain responsibility for initial TimeSpan creation

3.3. CompleteTimerAction:

- Ensure proper TimeSpan closure when blocks complete
- Focus on popping blocks from the stack

3.4. UpdateMetricsAction:

- Refactor to eliminate type assertions
- Implement a cleaner interface to access blocks by key
- Coordinate with action-created TimeSpans

## Success Criteria

1. All TimeSpans have proper start and stop timestamps
2. Metrics are accurately calculated and aggregated according to block relationships
3. No type assertions in metrics-related code
4. Code follows SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns
5. UI displays accurate workout metrics
6. All test cases pass

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Phase 1: Action System and RuntimeBlock Enhancements

- Enhance actions (Start/Stop/Complete) to properly manage TimeSpans
- Update `RuntimeBlock` to work with action-created TimeSpans
- Add enhanceResultSpan and processBlockMetrics methods
- Create unit tests for TimeSpan management in actions

### 2. Phase 2: Block Type-Specific Implementations

- Implement enhanceResultSpan for each block type
- Update onLeave methods to use finalizeBlockMetrics
- Create unit tests for each block type's metrics aggregation

### 3. Phase 3: Action System Updates

- Refactor actions to focus on their core responsibilities
- Remove TimeSpan management from actions
- Create unit tests for the updated action behavior

### 4. Phase 4: Integration Testing

- Ensure all components work together correctly
- Verify metrics are properly tracked and displayed
- Fix any integration issues

## Impact and Dependencies

- The changes will impact the core runtime system but should be backward compatible
- UI components may need updates to handle the enhanced metrics
- Existing tests may need to be updated to align with the new implementation

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Changes to core components could introduce regressions
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

- **Risk**: Metrics calculations could become inconsistent during transition
  - **Mitigation**: Create validation functions to verify metrics integrity

- **Risk**: Complex blocks like RepeatingBlock might have nuanced metrics behavior
  - **Mitigation**: Create specific test cases for each group type and nesting level
