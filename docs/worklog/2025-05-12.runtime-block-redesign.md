# Runtime Block Redesign Plan  
*Date: 2025-05-12*

---

## Objective
Modernise `src/core/runtime/blocks` by separating **state**, **behaviour**, and **UI concerns** so that each responsibility is independently testable and extensible.  The end-goal is to:

* Remove duplicated logic (logging, result spans, button management).
* Align blocks with the strategy pattern already used elsewhere in the runtime.
* Improve SOLID-ness and unit-test coverage.

A newcomer should be able to follow the sections below, walk through the Kanban board, and complete the refactor.

## Kanban – Cards Format
> Note:  Move tasks between columns as work progresses.  Use ▶️ timestamps in *Doing* / ✅ timestamps in *Closed*.

### Future `#future`
- [ ] *Potential* – Replace console logging with a structured logger (e.g., pino)  
- [ ] *Potential* – Auto-generate block metrics via decorators
- [ ] Step 8 – Add **unit tests** for each strategy - *Waiting for more strategies to be implemented*  
- [ ] Step 9 – Update **runtime & developer docs** - *Will be done last*

### ToDo *(Backlog)*
<!-- Next tasks will be added here -->

### Doing *(2025-05-12)*
<!-- Items actively being worked on get moved here with the current date -->

### Closed *(Completed)*
- [x] ✅ 2025-05-12T21:30 - Step 1 – Create **`BlockContext`** object
- [x] ✅ 2025-05-12T21:35 - Step 2 – Create **`AbstractBlockLifecycle`** with template methods
- [x] ✅ 2025-05-12T21:39 - Step 7 – Introduce **ResultBuilder** utility

# Detailed Steps

## Step 1 – `BlockContext` (State Holder)
**Summary**:  Groups all per-block mutable state so lifecycle methods are stateless and easier to test.

```ts
// src/core/runtime/blocks/BlockContext.ts
export interface BlockContext {
  runtime: ITimerRuntime;
  index: number;
  childIndex?: number;
  lastLap?: string;
  spans: ITimeSpan[];
}
```

*Tasks*
- [ ] Introduce `BlockContext` type & create instance in each concrete block constructor.  
- [ ] Replace direct property mutations (`this.index++`) with `ctx.index++`.

---

## Step 6 – Encapsulation
*Tasks*
- [ ] Mark `sources`, `parent`, `spans` as `protected`.  
- [ ] Provide read-only getters where needed.

---

## Step 7 – `ResultBuilder`
**Summary**:  Consistent creation of `ResultSpan` objects.

```ts
const span = ResultBuilder
  .forBlock(block)
  .withMetrics(block.sources[0].metrics())
  .build();
```

*Tasks*
- [ ] Utility under `runtime/results/ResultBuilder.ts`.  
- [ ] Replace manual `new ResultSpan()` constructions.

---

## Step 9 – Documentation
*Tasks*
- [ ] Update `docs/Components/Runtime.md` with new class diagram.  
- [ ] Add migration notes for plugin developers.

---

## Final Notes
* Adhere to **SOLID** principles at each step.
* Keep PRs small; one major step per PR.
* Ensure CI tests pass after every step.
