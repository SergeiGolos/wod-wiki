# Wod.Wiki Runtime Actions Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the current implementation of the `Actions` system in the Wod.Wiki runtime against architectural expectations outlined in the grounding documents. The focus is on identifying any discrepancies between how actions are expected to operate (particularly regarding `ITimerSegments` and `ResultSpan` tracking) and their actual implementation.

## Core Findings

### TimeSpan and RuntimeSpan Management

According to the architectural documentation, actions should properly manage `TimeSpan` and `RuntimeSpan` objects to track workout progress and metrics accurately. This is critical for the `ResultSpan` system that captures exercise performance.

### 1. StartTimerAction Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
- Properly manages the relationship between `RuntimeSpan` and `TimeSpan` objects
- Correctly adds `TimeSpan` objects to the current block's `spans` collection
- Handles various cases:
  - Creates a new `RuntimeSpan` if none exists
  - Adds a new `TimeSpan` with proper start timestamp
  - Handles situations where an existing `TimeSpan` needs to be closed before starting a new one

```typescript
// From StartTimerAction.ts
const timestampEvent = this.event;
let currentRuntimeSpan: RuntimeSpan | undefined = block.spans.length > 0 ? block.spans[block.spans.length - 1] : undefined;

if (!currentRuntimeSpan || currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.length === 0) {
  // Case 1: No RuntimeSpan exists, or the last one has no ITimeSpans.
  // Create a new RuntimeSpan, add a new ITimeSpan to it, and add the RuntimeSpan to the block.
  currentRuntimeSpan = new RuntimeSpan();
  currentRuntimeSpan.blockKey = block.blockKey;
  
  const newITimeSpan: ITimeSpan = { start: timestampEvent };
  currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.push(newITimeSpan);
  block.spans.push(currentRuntimeSpan);
} else {
  // Case 2: A RuntimeSpan exists and has ITimeSpans.
  let lastITimeSpan: ITimeSpan = currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans[currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.length - 1];

  if (lastITimeSpan.stop) {
    // Subcase 2a: The last ITimeSpan is already stopped. Start a new one.
    const newITimeSpan: ITimeSpan = { start: timestampEvent };
    currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.push(newITimeSpan);
  } else {
    // Subcase 2b: The last ITimeSpan is running. Stop it and start a new one.
    lastITimeSpan.stop = timestampEvent;
    const newITimeSpan: ITimeSpan = { start: timestampEvent };
    currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.push(newITimeSpan);
  }
}
```

**✅ Verdict:** The StartTimerAction correctly implements the expected behavior for managing TimeSpans within RuntimeSpans.

### 2. StopTimerAction Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// From StopTimerAction.ts
const block = runtime.trace.current();
if (!block) {
  return;
}
console.log(`+=== stop_timer : ${block.blockKey}`);

// Check if we need to update the clock
const duration = block.selectMany(getDuration)[0];
if (duration !== undefined) {
  input.next(
    new PushActionEvent(new SetClockAction("primary"))
  );
}
```

**❌ Issue:** The StopTimerAction does not update the current block's RuntimeSpan/TimeSpan structures. It only:
1. Logs a console message
2. Potentially updates the UI clock display

This contrasts with the StartTimerAction implementation and violates the expected pattern where each TimeSpan should have both `start` and `stop` properties set.

**Expected Implementation:** The StopTimerAction should:
1. Find the current RuntimeSpan for the block
2. Find the last TimeSpan that was started
3. Set its `stop` property to the current event timestamp
4. Update any relevant metrics based on the completed TimeSpan

### 3. CompleteTimerAction Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// From CompleteTimerAction.ts
runtime.pop();
```

**⚠️ Issue:** The CompleteTimerAction simply pops the current block from the runtime stack without ensuring that any open TimeSpans are properly closed. This could lead to TimeSpans with missing `stop` properties, affecting duration calculations and metrics.

### 4. UpdateMetricsAction Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// UpdateMetricsAction.ts excerpt
execute(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[] {
  // Find the block by key in the runtime blocks collection
  // Use type assertion to get blocks since we know runtime has blocks internally
  const blocks = (runtime as any).blocks || [];
  const block = blocks.find((b: { blockKey?: string }) => b.blockKey === this.blockKey);
  
  if (!block) {
    console.warn(`Block with key ${this.blockKey} not found for metrics update`);
    return [];
  }
  
  // Check if the block implements IMetricsProvider by detecting updateMetrics method
  if (typeof (block as any).updateMetrics === 'function') {
    // Update the metrics using the IMetricsProvider interface
    (block as any).updateMetrics(() => [...this.metrics]);
    
    // Emit a SetMetricAction to notify the UI of the metrics update
    return [new SetMetricAction(this.blockKey, this.metrics)];
  }
  
  return [];
}
```

**⚠️ Issues:**
1. Type assertions (`as any`) suggest potential architectural issues - the action shouldn't need to access internal runtime structures this way
2. The metrics update process doesn't seem to interact with the RuntimeSpan/TimeSpan system
3. The approach to finding blocks by key seems fragile

## Metrics Context and Relationship to TimeSpans

According to the `RuntimeMetricsDeepDive.md` document, the metrics system should work closely with the TimeSpan tracking:

1. `BlockContext` should manage both `MetricsContext` and the list of `ResultSpan`s 
2. When blocks complete, they should emit finalized `ResultSpan`s with proper metrics
3. Parent blocks should aggregate child metrics according to their `MetricsRelationshipType`

None of the actions examined seem to fully implement this relationship between TimeSpans and metrics as expected by the architecture.

## Subactions and Flow Issues

According to the original review request, we should flag cases where additional subactions are required. Several patterns reveal issues:

1. **Responsibility Misplacement**: Actions are handling responsibilities that should belong to block lifecycle methods
   - Example: Metrics updates should be managed by the block's `onLeave` method, not by chaining StopTimerAction to UpdateMetricsAction
   - Closing TimeSpans should be managed in the block's lifecycle, not by individual actions

2. **Direct Internal Access**: UpdateMetricsAction uses type assertions to access internal runtime structures
   - This suggests poor encapsulation or an incomplete interface design
   - A cleaner approach would be to have a well-defined API for metrics updates


3. **Incomplete State Management**: The StopTimerAction doesn't update TimeSpan state, which could lead to inconsistent metrics

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the current action implementations versus architectural expectations, the following changes are recommended:

### 2. RuntimeBlock Template Method Enhancement

Instead of modifying individual actions, enhance the RuntimeBlock's template methods to properly manage TimeSpans:

```typescript
// Proposed enhancement to RuntimeBlock.ts

// Enhanced template method that adds TimeSpan management
public enter(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[] {
  this.blockKey = BlockKey.create(this);
  console.log(`>>>>> doEnter >>>>>: ${this.blockKey} -- ${this.constructor.name}`);
  
  // Create a new RuntimeSpan for this block activation if one doesn't exist
  let currentSpan = this.spans.length > 0 ? this.spans[this.spans.length - 1] : undefined;
  if (!currentSpan) {
    currentSpan = new RuntimeSpan();
    currentSpan.blockKey = this.blockKey;
    this.spans.push(currentSpan);
  }
  
  // Start a new TimeSpan
  const now = Date.now();
  const startEvent = { timestamp: now }; // Or use a proper event from parameters
  const newTimeSpan: ITimeSpan = { start: startEvent };
  currentSpan.timeSpans.push(newTimeSpan);
  
  // Call the specific implementation
  const actions = this.onEnter(runtime);
  return actions;
}

public leave(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeAction[] {
  // Close any open TimeSpans
  if (this.spans.length > 0) {
    const currentSpan = this.spans[this.spans.length - 1];
    if (currentSpan && currentSpan.timeSpans.length > 0) {
      const lastTimeSpan = currentSpan.timeSpans[currentSpan.timeSpans.length - 1];
      if (lastTimeSpan && !lastTimeSpan.stop) {
        const now = Date.now();
        lastTimeSpan.stop = { timestamp: now }; // Or use a proper event
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Call the specific implementation
  const actions = this.onLeave(runtime);
  console.log(`<<<<< doLeave <<<<<: ${this.blockKey} -- ${this.constructor.name}`);
  return actions;
}
```

### 3. RuntimeBlock Metrics Management

Implement proper metrics management in RuntimeBlock with a clear API for subclasses:

```typescript
apply(
  runtime: ITimerRuntime,
  input: Subject<IRuntimeEvent>,
  output: Subject<OutputEvent>
): void {
  const block = runtime.trace.current();
  if (block) {
    // Ensure all TimeSpans are properly closed
    if (block.spans.length > 0) {
      const currentRuntimeSpan = block.spans[block.spans.length - 1];
      if (currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.length > 0) {
        const lastTimeSpan = currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans[currentRuntimeSpan.timeSpans.length - 1];
        if (!lastTimeSpan.stop) {
          lastTimeSpan.stop = { timestamp: Date.now() }; // Or use a proper event
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  runtime.pop();
}
```

### 4. Block Type-Specific Implementations

Each block type should implement `enhanceResultSpan` according to its metrics relationship:

```typescript
// Example for EffortBlock
@Override
protected enhanceResultSpan(span: RuntimeSpan): void {
  // Add metrics from source fragments
  const calculatedMetrics = this.calculateMetrics();
  span.metrics.push(...calculatedMetrics);
}

// Example for RepeatingBlock
@Override
protected enhanceResultSpan(span: RuntimeSpan): void {
  // Get the rounds information
  const sourceNode = this.sources?.[0];
  const rounds = sourceNode?.round(0);
  const roundCount = rounds?.count || 1;
  
  // For each child span we've collected
  const childMetrics = this.collectChildMetrics();
  
  // Apply appropriate MULTIPLY relationship for rounds
  if (this.groupType === 'compose') {
    // Sum composed child metrics, then multiply by rounds
    // Logic for compose groups
  } else if (this.groupType === 'round') {
    // Sum metrics from each child execution across rounds
    // Logic for round-robin groups
  } else { // default 'repeat'
    // Sum the total metrics from each child's full execution
    // Logic for repeat groups
  }
  
  span.metrics.push(...aggregatedMetrics);
}

// Example for RootBlock
@Override
protected enhanceResultSpan(span: RuntimeSpan): void {
  // Aggregate metrics from all top-level blocks (ADD relationship)
  const aggregatedMetrics = this.aggregateChildMetrics();
  span.metrics.push(...aggregatedMetrics);
  
  // Add overall workout summary metrics
  span.metrics.push({
    sourceId: this.blockId,
    effort: 'workout',
    values: [{ type: 'duration', value: this.getTotalDuration(), unit: 'ms' }]
  });
}
```

### 5. TimeSpan-ResultSpan Integration

Ensure proper integration between the TimeSpan tracking system and the metrics system:

1. When a TimeSpan completes (gets a `stop` value), calculate and update associated metrics
2. When a block completes, ensure its ResultSpan includes accurate metrics derived from its TimeSpans
3. Implement proper aggregation of child metrics in parent blocks according to their MetricsRelationshipType

Ensure proper integration between the TimeSpan tracking system and the metrics system:

1. When a TimeSpan completes (gets a `stop` value), calculate and update associated metrics
2. When a block completes, ensure its ResultSpan includes accurate metrics derived from its TimeSpans
3. Implement proper aggregation of child metrics in parent blocks according to their MetricsRelationshipType

## Implementation Across Different Block Types

To properly implement metrics reporting in the `onLeave` method across different block types, we need to consider their unique characteristics:

### 1. EffortBlock

The `EffortBlock` represents individual exercises. Its `onLeave` implementation should:

- Close any open TimeSpans
- Calculate metrics from its source fragments (effort, reps, resistance, distance)
- Create a ResultSpan with the calculated metrics
- Emit the ResultSpan through a WriteResultAction

### 2. TimedGroupBlock

The `TimedGroupBlock` (e.g., AMRAPs/EMOMs) should:

- Close the overall block timer
- Aggregate metrics from all child blocks executed during its time period
- Use ADD relationship to sum metrics from child spans
- Include total rounds completed if applicable
- Create a comprehensive ResultSpan for the entire timed session

### 3. RepeatingBlock

The `RepeatingBlock` handles multiple rounds of one or more activities. Its `onLeave` should:

- Aggregate metrics according to its group type:
  - Compose (`+` operator): Sum metrics from composed children, then multiply by rounds
  - Round-Robin (`-` operator): Sum metrics from each child executed across all rounds
  - Repeat (default): Sum the total metrics from each child's full execution
- Track and report total rounds completed
- Include time-based metrics if relevant

### 4. RootBlock

The `RootBlock` represents the entire workout. Its `onLeave` should:

- Aggregate metrics from all top-level blocks
- Calculate overall workout statistics (total time, total reps across all exercises, etc.)
- Provide a comprehensive workout summary

## Conclusion

By shifting responsibility for metrics management from actions to the block `onLeave` methods:

1. We ensure proper SOLID principles by strengthening the separation of concerns:
   - Blocks are responsible for their own metrics and state
   - Actions focus on runtime flow control and UI updates

2. The system becomes more maintainable and robust:
   - Metrics calculations are co-located with the block logic that generates them
   - TimeSpan tracking is consistently managed at the block level
   - Metrics aggregation follows clear relationship rules (ADD, MULTIPLY, INHERIT)

3. The architecture is cleaner:
   - No need for complex action chaining
   - Reduced coupling between actions and blocks
   - More predictable flow of metrics data

These changes will align the implementation with the architectural expectations documented in `RuntimeMetricsDeepDive.md` and ensure accurate workout tracking and metrics reporting.
