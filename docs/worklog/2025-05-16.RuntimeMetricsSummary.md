# Summary of RuntimeMetrics Assembly and Relationships in wod.wiki

This document outlines how `RuntimeMetric` objects are created, assembled, and managed within the wod.wiki runtime system. It details the roles of different block types in generating and aggregating metrics.

## 1. `RuntimeMetric` Structure

- Definition (effort, repetitions, resistance, distance) - as per memory `74eb0117-4e09-4991-bdfd-20d4a63f10cc`.
- Purpose: To capture quantifiable results of workout components.

## 2. Metric Creation

- **`EffortBlock`**: Primary generator of `RuntimeMetric` instances for individual exercises.
  - Metrics are derived from `PrecompiledNode` sources passed during its construction, which contain parsed workout data (e.g., exercise name, repetitions, weight, distance).
  - Manages its metrics within its own `MetricsContext`, initialized with `MetricsRelationshipType.INHERIT` (via `AbstractBlockLifecycle`).
  - During its lifecycle, particularly in its overridden `enhanceResultSpan` and `doLeave` methods, it adds further details like 'Last Updated' timestamps, completion timestamps, and a 'Status: completed' metric to its `ResultSpan` (stored in `BlockContext`).
- **`RuntimeJit`**: As per memory `74eb0117-4e09-4991-bdfd-20d4a63f10cc`, `RuntimeJit` plays a role in the initial compilation of the workout. `AbstractBlockLifecycle`'s `initializeMetrics` method, using `MetricsFactory`, then creates the `RuntimeMetric` structures from `PrecompiledNode`s for each block.

## 3. Metric Aggregation and Inheritance by Block Type

This section describes how different runtime blocks handle metrics, particularly in terms of merging metrics from child blocks or inheriting them. The core aggregation logic (ADD, MULTIPLY, INHERIT) resides in `MetricsContext.getMetrics()`, orchestrated by `AbstractBlockLifecycle`.

### 3.1. `EffortBlock`

- Its `MetricsContext` (initialized by `AbstractBlockLifecycle`) contains base metrics from its `PrecompiledNode` sources.
- Uses `MetricsRelationshipType.INHERIT`. It doesn't aggregate child metrics.
- Its overridden `enhanceResultSpan` method dynamically adds detailed descriptions (e.g., "10 Pullups 50kg") and timestamps to its `ResultSpan`.

### 3.2. `RepeatingBlock`

- Its `MetricsContext` is initialized with `MetricsRelationshipType.MULTIPLY` by `AbstractBlockLifecycle`.
  - When its `getMetrics()` is called (likely by a parent or for final summary), `MetricsContext` will handle multiplying the metrics of its children (representing one round) by the number of rounds completed (`this.ctx.index`).
- **`ResultSpan` Enhancements (via overridden `enhanceResultSpan`)**:
  - Updates the `ResultSpan` label with round progress.
  - Adds a 'Rounds' `RuntimeMetric`.
  - When a round completes (in `doNext()`), generates a 'Round Complete' metric and adds it to the current `ResultSpan` (via `this.ctx.addMetricsToResultSpan()`).

### 3.3. `TimedGroupBlock`

- Its `MetricsContext` is initialized with `MetricsRelationshipType.ADD` by `AbstractBlockLifecycle`.
- **`ResultSpan` Enhancements (via overridden `enhanceResultSpan`)**:
  - This is where it aggregates metrics from its children. It calls `getMetrics()` on each child block (which in turn uses their `MetricsContext`).
  - The summed child metrics are then added to its own `ResultSpan` via `this.ctx.addMetricsToResultSpan()`.
  - Manages child `ResultSpan`s via its `childSpanRegistry` to facilitate this aggregation.

### 3.4. `RootBlock`

- Its `MetricsContext` is initialized by `AbstractBlockLifecycle`, likely defaulting to `MetricsRelationshipType.ADD`.
- When its `doLeave()` method is called:
  - Its `ResultSpan` (created on `enter` and stored in `this.ctx`) is finalized.
  - The call to `ResultSpan.fromBlock(this)` (or an equivalent `this.getMetrics(true,true)`) triggers its `MetricsContext` to aggregate metrics from all its direct children (top-level workout segments).
- The final `ResultSpan` contains the grand total for the workout and is emitted by `WriteResultAction`.

### 3.5. Other Blocks

- `IdleRuntimeBlock`, `DoneRuntimeBlock`: Typically do not generate significant performance metrics. Their `MetricsContext` would be minimal, and they wouldn't override `enhanceResultSpan` extensively.

## 4. Role of `BlockContext`

`BlockContext` serves as the stateful companion to `RuntimeBlock` instances, crucial for metric management by providing storage and basic manipulation tools for `ITimeSpan`s and `ResultSpan`s. It does not perform aggregation logic itself.

- **State Holding**: Stores `index`, `childIndex`, `spans` (array of `ITimeSpan`), `resultSpans` (array of `ResultSpan`), `blockKey`, etc.
- **`ResultSpan` Management**: 
  - `createResultSpan()`: Called by `AbstractBlockLifecycle.createResultSpan()` to instantiate a new `ResultSpan` when a block begins execution. This span is stored in `ctx.resultSpans`.
  - `getCurrentResultSpan()`: Allows blocks to retrieve their active `ResultSpan` for updates during their lifecycle (e.g., in `enhanceResultSpan`).
  - `addMetricsToResultSpan()`: Key method used by block-specific `enhanceResultSpan` overrides to add generated or aggregated `RuntimeMetric` arrays to their `ResultSpan`.
  - `completeResultSpan()`: Marks a `ResultSpan` as complete, typically called by `AbstractBlockLifecycle.leave()`.
- **Facilitator**: `BlockContext` provides the mutable storage for `ResultSpan` objects that are populated by `AbstractBlockLifecycle` and its concrete subclasses.

## 5. Role of `AbstractBlockLifecycle`

`AbstractBlockLifecycle` implements the Template Method pattern and is central to orchestrating metric initialization, `ResultSpan` management, and providing access to aggregated metrics.

- **Initialization & `MetricsContext` Setup**:
  - In its constructor, it creates a `MetricsContext` for the block, establishing its `MetricsRelationshipType` (ADD, MULTIPLY, INHERIT) and linking it to a parent `MetricsContext` if applicable.
  - Calls `initializeMetrics()`, which uses a `MetricsFactory` to create base `RuntimeMetric` objects from the `PrecompiledNode` sources and adds them to the block's `MetricsContext`.
- **Metric Calculation (`getMetrics`)**: 
  - Implements `IMetricsProvider`.
  - Its `getMetrics(includeChildren, inheritFromParent)` method delegates directly to `this.metricsContext.getMetrics()`. This is where the actual hierarchical aggregation (ADD, MULTIPLY) or INHERITance logic defined by `MetricsRelationshipType` is executed by the `MetricsContext`.
- **`ResultSpan` Lifecycle Orchestration**:
  - **`enter()`**: Calls its `createResultSpan()` helper, which in turn calls `this.ctx.createResultSpan()` to make a new `ResultSpan` for the current execution. It then calls `this.enhanceResultSpan()` for initial population.
  - **`enhanceResultSpan(span)` (Protected Hook)**: This is a key extension point. The base version adds default metrics. Subclasses override it to:
    - Add their own specific metrics (e.g., 'Round Complete' for `RepeatingBlock`).
    - For aggregator blocks (like `TimedGroupBlock`), fetch aggregated metrics from children (by calling `child.getMetrics()`) and add them to their own `span` (using `this.ctx.addMetricsToResultSpan()`).
  - **`leave()`**: Performs a final call to `enhanceResultSpan()` on the current `ResultSpan`, then calls `this.ctx.completeResultSpan()`. It also calls `updateMetricsContextFromSpans()` to potentially sync the `MetricsContext` with data from the `ResultSpan`s (though primary aggregation for `getMetrics()` relies on the `MetricsContext` hierarchy).
- **Overall Flow**: `AbstractBlockLifecycle` sets up the `MetricsContext` (which knows how to calculate its total metrics). It also manages the `ResultSpan` for an execution instance, allowing subclasses to fill this `ResultSpan` with the relevant metrics that will eventually be reported.

## 6. Conclusion

`RuntimeMetrics` are initialized from script definitions by `AbstractBlockLifecycle` (using `MetricsFactory`) and stored in a block's `MetricsContext`. The `MetricsContext` itself, governed by `MetricsRelationshipType`, is responsible for calculating a block's total metrics, including aggregation from children when its `getMetrics()` method is called. During runtime, each block execution gets a `ResultSpan` (managed via `BlockContext` and `AbstractBlockLifecycle`). Blocks populate their `ResultSpan` (via overridden `enhanceResultSpan` methods) with their specific metrics and/or metrics aggregated from children (obtained by calling `child.getMetrics()`). This `ResultSpan` is then emitted upon block completion, providing a snapshot of that block's performance for that specific run.
