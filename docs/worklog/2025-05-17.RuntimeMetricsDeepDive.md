# Wod.Wiki - Runtime Metrics Deep Dive

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose

This document provides a detailed explanation of the runtime metrics system within Wod.Wiki. It covers how metrics are defined, generated, aggregated, tracked internally, and displayed in the user interface. Understanding this system is crucial for developers working on the runtime engine, UI components related to results display, or extending workout tracking capabilities.

### 1.2. Importance of Metrics

Runtime metrics are the quantitative record of a user's performance during a workout. They provide valuable feedback, enable progress tracking, and form the basis for analytics. Accurate and comprehensive metrics are key to the user experience.

## 2. `RuntimeMetric` Data Structure (`timer.types.ts`)

The core data structure for representing metrics is `RuntimeMetric`.

- `RuntimeMetric`:
  - `effort: string`: The name or description of the exercise or effort.
  - `sourceId: string`: Unique identifier for the metric source.
  - `values: MetricValue[]`: Array of metric values containing repetitions, resistance, distance, etc.

- `MetricValue`:
  - `type: string`: The type of metric ("repetitions", "resistance", "distance", etc.).
  - `value: number`: The numerical value of the metric.
  - `unit: string`: The unit of measurement (e.g., "kg", "lb", "m", "km", "ft").

This structure ensures consistency in how different types of performance data are handled throughout the application.

## 3. Metrics Generation and `MetricsContext`

- Initialization: `RuntimeMetric` objects are typically initialized from `PrecompiledNode` sources (via `Fragment`s like `EffortFragment`, `RepFragment`, etc.) using reader functions (e.g., `getMetrics`).

- `RuntimeBlock` Role: The `RuntimeBlock` base class plays a key role. During its initialization (often in the constructor or `onEnter`), it creates a `MetricsContext` for the block instance. This might involve a `MetricsFactory` for consistent creation.

- `MetricsContext`: Each block instance possesses a `MetricsContext` (`this.context.metrics`) which holds:
  - The `RuntimeMetric` data for the block.
  - Is governed by a `MetricsRelationshipType` which defines how its metrics relate to its parent and child blocks.

- `MetricsRelationshipType`:
  - `ADD`: Metrics from child blocks are summed up and added to this block's metrics (e.g., `RootBlock`, `TimedGroupBlock`).
  - `MULTIPLY`: Metrics from this block are multiplied by a factor (e.g., number of rounds in a `RepeatingBlock`). The `RepeatingBlock` itself might also generate "Round Complete" type metrics.
  - `INHERIT`: The block directly uses or passes through the metrics defined at its level, typically from its source `PrecompiledNode`.

## 4. `ResultSpan` and Metric Emission

- Creation & Management: A `ResultSpan` is created for each execution instance of a block. This is typically managed by the `BlockContext` under the direction of `RuntimeBlock`'s lifecycle methods (`onEnter`, `onNext`, `onLeave`).

- Enhancement: Concrete block types override a method within `RuntimeBlock` (e.g., `enhanceResultSpan` or similar, or directly in `onLeave`) to populate their `ResultSpan` with specific metrics derived during their execution, or by aggregating metrics from their children (obtained by calling `child.getMetrics()`).

- Emission: Upon block completion (usually in `onLeave`), the finalized `ResultSpan` (containing duration, effort, reps, resistance, distance, etc.) is emitted, typically via a `WriteResultAction`. This action makes the metrics available to the UI and for aggregation by parent blocks.

## 5. Aggregation Logic in Parent Blocks

- `RepeatingBlock` (Handles Rounds):
  The `RepeatingBlock`'s `MetricsContext` relationship is typically `MULTIPLY` if it's simply repeating a single child or a composed set of children. However, its behavior becomes more nuanced based on the `groupType` implied by its structure or child `LapFragment`s (`+`, `-` operators).

  - Compose (`groupType: 'compose'`, from `+` operator):
    - Conceptual Aggregation: All child blocks within the compose group are executed as a single unit for each round of the `RepeatingBlock`.
    - Metrics: For one round of the `RepeatingBlock`, the metrics from all composed children are typically ADDED together. This sum (representing one full composed iteration) is then MULTIPLIED by the total number of rounds in the `RepeatingBlock`.
    - Example: `(3) rounds of (A + B)`. Metrics(A) and Metrics(B) are ADDED. (Metrics(A) + Metrics(B)) is then MULTIPLIED by 3.

  - Round-Robin (`groupType: 'round'`, from `-` operator):
    - Conceptual Aggregation: Each round of the `RepeatingBlock` cycles through one child from the round-robin set.
    - Metrics: The `RepeatingBlock`'s total metrics would be the SUM of metrics from each child executed across all rounds. If `RepeatingBlock` itself has a `MetricsRelationshipType` of `ADD`, it would sum the `ResultSpan` metrics from each child activation.
    - Example: `(3) rounds of (A - B - C)`. This means A runs, then B, then C (that's 1 parent round). Then A, B, C again (2nd parent round), etc. The `RepeatingBlock`'s total metrics = Metrics(A1)+Metrics(B1)+Metrics(C1) + Metrics(A2)+Metrics(B2)+Metrics(C2) + Metrics(A3)+Metrics(B3)+Metrics(C3).

  - Repeat (Default, `groupType: 'repeat'`):
    - Conceptual Aggregation: Each child element individually completes all rounds of the parent `RepeatingBlock` before the next child begins.
    - Metrics: This is the most complex. If child A (itself potentially a `RepeatingBlock` or a simple `EffortBlock`) completes all its parent-defined rounds, its total metrics are calculated. Then child B does the same. The parent `RepeatingBlock` would then SUM the total metrics from child A's full execution and child B's full execution.
    - Example: `(Parent: 2 rounds) of (ChildA: (3 rounds of X) then ChildB: 5 Y)`.
      - ChildA runs (3 rounds of X) for ParentRound1, then ChildA runs (3 rounds of X) for ParentRound2. Total for A = Metrics(3X) * 2 (if parent relationship is MULTIPLY, or just Metrics(3X) + Metrics(3X) if ADD).
      - Then ChildB runs 5 Y for ParentRound1, then ChildB runs 5 Y for ParentRound2. Total for B = Metrics(5Y) * 2 (or summed).
      - The overall `RepeatingBlock` metrics would be Total(A) + Total(B).

- `TimedGroupBlock` (e.g., AMRAPs/EMOMs):
  - Typically has a `MetricsRelationshipType` of `ADD`.
  - It sums the metrics from all `ResultSpan`s generated by its child blocks during its timed duration.
  - If it contains children that are part of a compose (`+`) or round-robin (`-`) structure (though less common for a top-level AMRAP container), those sub-groups would aggregate their metrics as described above, and their total would then be added to the `TimedGroupBlock`'s sum.

## 6. Internal State Tracking for Metrics

- `RuntimeStack`: As blocks are pushed onto and popped from the `RuntimeStack`, their `BlockContext` (containing `MetricsContext` and `ResultSpan` data) is managed.

- Data Flow:
  1. Raw fragments are parsed into `PrecompiledNode`s.
  2. `RuntimeJit` strategies compile `PrecompiledNode`s into `IRuntimeBlock`s.
  3. `RuntimeBlock` initializes `MetricsContext` for each block, using initial metrics from the node.
  4. As a block executes (`enter`, `next`, `leave` phases):
     - It may update its own `MetricsContext` based on its logic.
     - It may trigger child blocks.
     - Upon completion of a child, the parent block may aggregate the child's `ResultSpan` metrics into its own `MetricsContext` according to its `MetricsRelationshipType`.
  5. When a block itself completes, its `enhanceResultSpan()` method finalizes its `ResultSpan`, which is then stored/emitted.

- `BlockContext`: Holds the `MetricsContext` and the list of `ResultSpan`s generated by a block (if it can run multiple times or has sub-elements that generate spans).

## 7. UI Display and Expectations

The UI presents metrics to the user in a clear and understandable manner.

- Key UI Components:
  - `WodResults`: Displays a summary or detailed breakdown of completed workout metrics.
  - `WodTable`: May show metrics in a tabular format, possibly per round or per exercise.
  - `EventsView`: Could show a log of `ResultSpan` emissions, providing a granular view of metrics generation.
  - `WodResultsSectionHead`: Shows summary metrics with even spacing.

- Visual Cues:
  - Icons are used to differentiate metric types (e.g., üí™ for resistance, üìè for distance).
  - Units are always displayed alongside values.

- Real-time Updates: Some UI elements might update metrics in real-time as blocks complete and emit `ResultSpan`s, while others might update only at the end of the workout.

- Clarity: The UI should clearly distinguish between metrics for individual efforts, rounds, and the total workout.

## 8. Metrics in Group Operations

The group operators affect how metrics are aggregated:

- Round-Robin Operator (`-`): Metrics for each child item are typically logged individually as they are completed in their respective turns within the parent round. Aggregation at the parent level would sum these individual `ResultSpan`s.

- Compose Operator (`+`): All children are executed as a single unit per parent round. The `MetricsContext` of the parent (or a `TimedGroupBlock` if applicable) would use `ADD` relationship to sum metrics from all children for that composed unit.

- Repeat (No Operator): Each child individually goes through all parent rounds. The `RepeatingBlock` (parent) would likely use a `MULTIPLY` relationship for each child's metrics over the rounds, or sum the `ResultSpan`s from each child's full set of repetitions.

The specific `IRuntimeBlock` and `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` implementations for these group operations will define the precise metric aggregation logic.

## 9. Example Scenario: `3 Rounds of (Push Press 5 reps @60kg, 10 Cal Row)`

1. Parsing:
    - Parent `PrecompiledNode` (Repeating, 3 rounds)
        - Child `PrecompiledNode` ("Push Press", 5 reps, 60kg) -> `EffortFragment`, `RepFragment`, `ResistanceFragment`
        - Child `PrecompiledNode` ("10 Cal Row") -> `EffortFragment`, `RepFragment` (value 10, unit "Cal")

2. Runtime - Round 1:
    - `RepeatingBlock` (3 rounds) `enters`. `MetricsContext` (MULTIPLY).
    - `EffortBlock` ("Push Press") `enters`. `MetricsContext` (INHERIT).
        - Base metrics: { effort: "Push Press", reps: 5, resistance: {value: 60, unit: "kg"} }.
        - `EffortBlock` `leaves`. `ResultSpan`_PP1 created with these metrics.
    - `EffortBlock` ("10 Cal Row") `enters`. `MetricsContext` (INHERIT).
        - Base metrics: { effort: "Row", reps: 10, unit: "Cal" }.
        - `EffortBlock` `leaves`. `ResultSpan`_Row1 created.
    - `RepeatingBlock`'s `MetricsContext` might aggregate `ResultSpan`_PP1 and `ResultSpan`_Row1 for Round 1 summary if needed, or just store them.

3. Runtime - Rounds 2 & 3: Similar flow, creating `ResultSpan`_PP2, `ResultSpan`_Row2, `ResultSpan`_PP3, `ResultSpan`_Row3.

4. `RepeatingBlock` Completion:
    - When `RepeatingBlock` `leaves`, its `enhanceResultSpan()` is called.
    - It calculates its total metrics. This could be:
        - Sum of all child `ResultSpan`s: (PP1+Row1) + (PP2+Row2) + (PP3+Row3).
        - Or, if its base metric was "1 round", it might be { effort: "Rounds", reps: 3 } and the child spans are associated.
    - A final `ResultSpan`_RepeatingBlock is generated.

5. UI Display:
    - Could show:
        - Total workout summary from `RootBlock` (which aggregated `ResultSpan`_RepeatingBlock).
        - Per-round breakdown (PP1+Row1, PP2+Row2, PP3+Row3).
        - Individual exercise contributions (total Push Press reps/weight, total Row cals).

## 10. Extensibility

- Adding New Metric Types:
  1. Extend the `RuntimeMetric` interface in `timer.types.ts`.
  2. Update `MetricValue` if necessary.
  3. Modify parser/lexer and fragment types to capture the new data.
  4. Update reader functions (like `getMetrics`) to populate the new metric fields.
  5. Adjust `MetricsContext` and relevant block `enhanceResultSpan()` methods to handle/aggregate the new metric.
  6. Update UI components to display the new metric type.
