# Chromecast Integration Event System

## Backlog



## To Do

- ## Summary
  This plan outlines the development of a Chromecast integration feature for wod-wiki that will allow displaying workout timers on external screens via a well-defined event system. The feature will display a running clock with workout details (effort + reps + current round), handle paused states, and show an idle state. The approach emphasizes a clean interface that can be mocked during development to avoid constant changes to the harder-to-test Chromecast components.



- [ ] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Design event interface protocol for Chromecast communication
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for all event types
  - Define serialization/deserialization approach for cross-device communication
  - Ensure protocol can handle all timer states and transitions
  - Document protocol for future implementation of receiver app

- [ ] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Develop mocking system for Chromecast receiver
  - Create a MockChromecastReceiver for local development
  - Implement visual representation of how the cast screen would appear
  - Add toggle for switching between real and mock implementations
  - Include development tools for inspecting sent events

- [ ] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Implement sender module to dispatch events to Chromecast
  - Create ChromecastSender service with clean API
  - Implement connection management
  - Add event dispatching for all timer states
  - Ensure proper error handling and reconnection logic

- [ ] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Integrate with existing timer runtime
  - Extend Runtime component to emit Chromecast events
  - Add hooks to capture timer state changes
  - Ensure events include all necessary workout information
  - Maintain backward compatibility

- [ ] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Add UI controls for Chromecast functionality
  - Create cast button component
  - Implement connection status indicators
  - Add user settings for Chromecast preferences
  - Ensure responsive design works on all devices

## In Progress


## Done

- [x] 2025-04-17 00:08 - Define Chromecast event system requirements and architecture #active âœ… 2025-04-17 00:20
  - Identify all clock states (running, paused, idle)
  - Define data payload for each state
  - Document how workout information (effort, reps, round) should be displayed
  - Ensure compatibility with existing Runtime component
  - Created Chromecast.md documentation
  - Defined TypeScript interfaces in chromecast-events.ts
  - Implemented ChromecastSender service
  - Created MockChromecastReceiver component for testing
