## Findings

- The current implementation lacks a standalone Chromecast receiver app; only a React component (`CastReceiver.tsx`) exists, which is not a real receiver. 
	- **Important: This will be done in another project, that will consume the useCastReciver coder**  we shold not need to implment this.
- There is no clear separation between `useCastSender`, `useCastReceiver`, and `useLocalCast` hooks; only a sender-focused hook is present.
- The Chromecast namespace is defined in multiple places and is inconsistent, which can break sender/receiver communication.
- There is no observable-based event system for the receiver; sender logic is not fully decoupled from the UI.
- Chromecast receiver lifecycle events (`READY`, `SENDER_CONNECTED`, etc.) are not fully handled, and error/debug logging is limited.
- The implementation does not fully align with best practices from the Google Cast CAF v3 SDK, as outlined in the grounding document.

## Summary

To achieve the desired architecture and robust Chromecast integration, we must:
- Unify the namespace and protocol across sender/receiver.
- Separate hooks for sender, receiver, and local dev/test logic.
- Implement a real standalone receiver app per SDK best practices.
- Ensure all communication uses observables and robust event handling.
- Add comprehensive lifecycle and error/debug handling.

## To Do

- [ ] Unify Chromecast namespace in all files (#chromecast #future)
- [ ] Refactor hooks: implement `useCastSender`, `useCastReceiver`, `useLocalCast` (#chromecast #future)
- [ ] Decouple `ChromecastButton` to use only `useCastSender` (#chromecast #future)
- [ ] Create standalone receiver app with proper SDK initialization and event handling (#chromecast #future)
- [ ] Add debug/error logging and documentation (#chromecast #future)

## Goals (Original)

- 3 hooks useCastSender and useCastReceiver,  useLocalCast
- 1 component ChromecastButton that use useCastSender.

useCastSender should expose:
- state$ : Observable<ChromecastState>
- connect : start a connection
- disconnect : send messges will not get sent anymore
- sendMessage(event: ChromecastEvent)  (if a connection is not there simply ingnore message that are sent.)

useCastReceiver should expose:
- event$ : Observable<ChromecastEvent>

useLocalCast should expose:
- event$ : Observable<ChromecastEvent>
- state$ : Observable<ChromecastState>
- sendMessage(event: ChromecastEvent) 
- assume always connected state with all the events that would be genearted by the useCaseReceiver.
