## 00:07 - Plan Refactor useChromecast Hook

1.  ~~Remove Older API Logic (`chrome.cast`).~~
2.  ~~Simplify Initialization using only `cast.framework.CastContext`.~~
3.  ~~Consolidate State Management via `CAST_STATE_CHANGED` listener.~~
4.  ~~Update `connect` to use `context.requestSession()`.~~
5.  ~~Update `disconnect` to use `session?.stop()`.~~
6.  ~~Update `sendMessage` to get session via `context.getCurrentSession()`.~~
7.  ~~Review Types (`UseChromecastResult`).~~
8.  ~~Clean Up unused code/types.~~

### Summary

The goal is to simplify the `useChromecast.ts` hook by removing the fallback logic for the older `chrome.cast` API and relying solely on the modern `cast.framework.CastContext`, as recommended in the grounding documentation. This will improve clarity and maintainability.

### Completed Steps

*   [x]: 00:07 - Plan created.
*   [x]: 00:07 - User approved the plan.
*   [x]: 00:09 - Implemented refactoring of `useChromecast.ts`.

### Next Steps

*   [ ]: 00:09 - Test the refactored hook and related components.

## 00:20 - Plan Simplify useChromecast Interface

1.  Simplify returned state: `isConnected: boolean`, `isConnecting: boolean`, `deviceName: string | null`.
2.  Keep internal complexity for state management.
3.  Keep core functions: `connect`, `disconnect`, `sendMessage`.
4.  (Optional) Remove initial state check in `initializeCastApi`.

### Summary

Abstract the hook's internal state complexity, providing a simpler interface (boolean flags, device name) to consuming components, improving ease of use.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 00:20 - Plan created.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 00:20 - Implement the interface simplification for `useChromecast.ts`.

## 01:45 - Plan Adapt Chromecast Implementation to Working Example

1. Update `useChromecast.ts` to match the working example:
   - Update Application ID to match working example
   - Implement session management similar to working example
   - Add proper event listeners for cast availability
   - Update message handling with correct namespace format

2. Revise `ChromecastButton.tsx` to:
   - Fix property access to match updated hook
   - Implement proper connection flow as in working example
   - Add error handling for cast operations

3. Update receiver implementation:
   - Modify `CastReceiver.tsx` to use the correct message listener
   - Implement custom messaging with correct namespace format 
   - Handle session events properly
   - Improve UI display for cast device

4. Fix cast initialization in `index.tsx`:
   - Update receiver options
   - Add custom message channel configuration
   - Properly handle receiver startup

5. Update `index.html` if needed:
   - Ensure proper script loading order
   - Add any missing dependencies

### Summary

The current Chromecast implementation has several issues that prevent it from working correctly. The working example shows a properly structured implementation that successfully handles device discovery, connection management, and message passing. The action plan will focus on adapting our existing code to follow the same patterns as the working example, particularly in how sessions are established and messages are passed between the sender and receiver.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 01:45 - Created detailed plan for adapting Chromecast implementation.
* [x]: 01:45 - Updated `useChromecast.ts` hook to match working example.
* [x]: 01:45 - Updated `ChromecastButton.tsx` component.
* [x]: 01:45 - Revised receiver implementation in `CastReceiver.tsx` and `index.tsx`.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 01:45 - Test the new implementation.

## 01:58 - Summary of Chromecast Implementation Changes

   - Fixed message sending with proper callback approach

2. **ChromecastButton.tsx**:
   - Updated to work with the revised hook interface
   - Added improved UI states for available/connecting/connected
   - Added debugging capabilities with test message functionality
   - Implemented better error handling

3. **CastReceiver.tsx**:
   - Added proper message listener with the correct namespace
   - Added debug information display for troubleshooting
   - Improved event handling for all message types
   - Added proper cleanup on unmount

4. **index.tsx**:
   - Fixed initialization with proper options
   - Added custom namespace configuration
   - Improved error handling and startup sequence
   - Added TypeScript types for better development experience

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 01:58 - Completed implementation of all required changes.
* [x]: 01:58 - Documented the changes in the worklog.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 01:58 - The implementation should now be tested by running the application.
