## 00:07 - Plan Refactor useChromecast Hook

1.  ~~Remove Older API Logic (`chrome.cast`).~~
2.  ~~Simplify Initialization using only `cast.framework.CastContext`.~~
3.  ~~Consolidate State Management via `CAST_STATE_CHANGED` listener.~~
4.  ~~Update `connect` to use `context.requestSession()`.~~
5.  ~~Update `disconnect` to use `session?.stop()`.~~
6.  ~~Update `sendMessage` to get session via `context.getCurrentSession()`.~~
7.  ~~Review Types (`UseChromecastResult`).~~
8.  ~~Clean Up unused code/types.~~

### Summary

The goal is to simplify the `useChromecast.ts` hook by removing the fallback logic for the older `chrome.cast` API and relying solely on the modern `cast.framework.CastContext`, as recommended in the grounding documentation. This will improve clarity and maintainability.

### Completed Steps

*   [x]: 00:07 - Plan created.
*   [x]: 00:07 - User approved the plan.
*   [x]: 00:09 - Implemented refactoring of `useChromecast.ts`.

### Next Steps

*   [ ]: 00:09 - Test the refactored hook and related components.

## 00:20 - Plan Simplify useChromecast Interface

1.  Simplify returned state: `isConnected: boolean`, `isConnecting: boolean`, `deviceName: string | null`.
2.  Keep internal complexity for state management.
3.  Keep core functions: `connect`, `disconnect`, `sendMessage`.
4.  (Optional) Remove initial state check in `initializeCastApi`.

### Summary

Abstract the hook's internal state complexity, providing a simpler interface (boolean flags, device name) to consuming components, improving ease of use.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 00:20 - Plan created.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 00:20 - Implement the interface simplification for `useChromecast.ts`.
