## 16:26 - Plan: Fix Button Menu State Updates

1. Investigate button state management in EditorContainer.tsx
2. Examine how button state is propagated from Runtime to UI
3. Identify issues preventing state updates from impacting the button menu
4. Implement fixes to ensure proper state reactivity

### Summary

Found two key issues affecting button menu state updates:
1. The useEffect interval in useTimerRuntime.ts had no dependencies, potentially working with stale values
2. Button array references weren't being properly handled to trigger React rerenders

Code examples:
```typescript
// Added proper dependencies to useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  // Interval code
}, [stack, runtimeRef]);

// Created new button array reference
this.onSetButtons([...this.buttons]);
```

### Completed Steps

* [x] 16:26 - Investigated button state management in EditorContainer.tsx
* [x] 16:28 - Examined timer button components and how state propagates
* [x] 16:30 - Identified issues with dependency array and reference handling
* [x] 16:32 - Fixed useEffect dependency array in useTimerRuntime.ts
* [x] 16:33 - Improved button array reference handling in timer.runtime.ts
* [x] 16:34 - Fixed a lint warning by removing unused import

### Next Steps

* [ ] 16:35 - Verify the fix works by testing different workout states (running, paused, etc.)
* [ ] 16:36 - Check for any other components that might have similar reactivity issues
