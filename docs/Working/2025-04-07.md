## 11:47 - Plan WodResults Table Reorganization

### Plan

1. Modify the table header structure to use the new format: "Time | Reps | Weight / Distance"
2. Redesign the summary grouping records as card-style elements
3. Add metrics summary for each group
4. Include child count for rounds in the summary cards
5. Update the styling to make the cards visually distinct
6. Ensure proper responsiveness for the new layout

### Summary

We've transformed the current table-based WodResults component into a more modern design with:
- A simplified table header focusing on key metrics (Time, Reps, Weight/Distance)
- Card-style summary groups that display aggregated metrics
- Better visual hierarchy between summary groups and detailed records
- Count indicators showing the number of child elements in each group

The implementation includes:
- Card-style summary sections with expandable/collapsible functionality
- Visual indicators (emoji icons) for different metric types
- Clean, borderless design with subtle shadows
- Responsive grid layout for the metrics summary
- Cleaner table structure for the detailed view
- Added calculation for total weight/distance metrics
- Circular +/- toggle buttons on the right side of each summary card with improved alignment
- All sections collapsed by default for a cleaner initial view

```tsx
// Example of the new card-style summary component
<div className="summary-card bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow p-3 mb-3">
  <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
    <h3 className="font-semibold">{group.effort}</h3>
    <span className="badge">{group.items.length} rounds</span>
  </div>
  <div className="metrics-summary grid grid-cols-3 mt-2">
    <div>‚è±Ô∏è {group.totalTime}s</div>
    <div>üîÑ {group.totalReps} reps</div>
    <div>üìè {totalWeightDistance}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
