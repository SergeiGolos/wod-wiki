# Lap Timers Feature Design Document

## Background

### Existing Workout Execution Process

The wod.wiki platform currently processes workout scripts through a well-defined pipeline:

1. **Lexer & Parser**: The workout text is tokenized in `timer.tokens.ts` and parsed into a structured syntax tree in `timer.parser.ts`.
2. **Visitor & Interpretation**: The `timer.visitor.ts` transforms the syntax tree into a runtime structure.
3. **Runtime Execution**: The `Runtime` component processes the workout script via an event-driven architecture.
4. **UI Rendering**: The execution state is reflected through `DisplayUpdateAction`, `SetButtonAction`, and `SetResultAction`.

Currently, the system supports basic workout structures including:
- Time-based exercises (`:20`, `1:30`)
- Repetition-based exercises (`21 Pullups`)
- Weight/resistance tracking (`95lb Thrusters`)
- Distance measurements (`25m Run`)
- Round notations like `(21-15-9)` or `(5)`

However, the platform lacks sophisticated lap/round tracking for complex workout structures that involve grouping, round-robin rotations, or composition of exercises.

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Group Tracking**: The system doesn't effectively track progress within grouped exercises.
2. **No Round-Robin Support**: There's no way to rotate through a list of exercises in a round-robin fashion.
3. **Composition Gaps**: Combining multiple exercises as a single unit lacks proper runtime tracking.
4. **Metrics Aggregation**: Analytics don't properly aggregate metrics across laps/rounds/groups.

### Runtime Metric Structure

The platform uses a `RuntimeMetric` type that includes:
- `effort`: Exercise name
- `repetitions`: Count
- `resistance`: Weight value and unit (optional)
- `distance`: Distance value and unit (optional)

This structure needs extension to support grouping and lap information.

## Feature Design: Lap/Group/Round-Robin Counters

### Conceptual Mechanics

We're introducing three group operation types that will be identified by specific operators:

1. **Round-Robin Operator** (`-`): Each iteration of the parent round moves to the next item in the list.
   ```
   (3)
     - 10 Pullups
     - 20 Pushups
     - 30 Squats
   ```
   This would execute: Round 1: Pullups, Round 2: Pushups, Round 3: Squats

2. **Compose Operator** (`+`): All children are executed as a single unit per round.
   ```
   (3)
     + 10 Pullups
     + 20 Pushups
     + 30 Squats
   ```
   This would execute: Round 1-3: Pullups, then Pushups, then Squats (all three exercises in each round)

3. **Repeat** (no operator): Each child individually goes through the parent's round count.
   ```
   (3)
     10 Pullups
     20  Pushups
   ```
   This would execute: 3 rounds of Pullups, then 3 rounds of Pushups

### Implementation Mechanics

#### Parser & Visitor Changes
- The visitor needs to annotate `StatementNode` with group type (`roundrobin`, `compose`, `repeat`)
- Nested groups require hierarchical tracking of lap/round state

#### Runtime Changes
- Extend the runtime state to track:
  - Current group type
  - Current lap/round within each group
  - Group execution context
- Implement specialized compiler strategies for each group type

#### UI Changes
- Update `TimerDisplay` to show current lap/round/group context
- Enhance `ResultsDisplay` to visualize group structure
- Add group-aware visualization cues

   - [ ] Add/extend tests for visitor, runtime, and UI for these cases
   - [ ] Test parser with various group structures
   - [ ] Validate runtime execution for each group type
   - [ ] Verify metrics aggregation

- [ ] **Integration Testing** #future 
   - [ ] Test full execution pipeline with complex workouts

## Summary

- [ ] **Feature Summary**
    Implement lap/group/roundrobin lap counters, supporting tracking and display of laps for workouts with group or round-robin structures in both runtime and UI.
    
    This feature enhances the workout tracking system by adding support for complex workout structures including round-robin rotation, composition of exercises, and proper lap counting across nested groups.

   - '+' (compose-operator): Include all children as a single round
   - Default (no operator): Each child independently goes through the parent group's rounds
