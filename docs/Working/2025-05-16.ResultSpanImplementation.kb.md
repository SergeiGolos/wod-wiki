# 2025-05-16 IRuntimeBlock ResultSpan Implementation

## Future

- [ ] Validate the component test coverage #future
- [ ] Implement real-time visualization of ResultSpan metrics #future
- [ ] Add serialization support for ResultSpan history #future

## ToDo

- [ ] Update metrics collection system to leverage ResultSpans
  - Modify `metrics()` methods to extract data from ResultSpans
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing metric consumers
  - Add real-time metric updates as spans are created/updated

- [ ] Update UI components to use the enhanced ResultSpan data
  - Modify `ResultsDisplay` to read from the ResultSpan collection
  - Create visual representations of block-specific span data
  - Add filtering and drill-down capabilities for span inspection
