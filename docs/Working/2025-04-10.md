## 00:19 - Plan Remove Grouped View, Add Effort Filter

1.  **Identify and Remove Grouped View:** Locate and remove the code related to the "Grouped" tab/view in `ResultsDisplay.tsx` and potentially `AnalyticsView.tsx`.
2.  **Add Filter State:** Introduce state (e.g., `selectedEffortFilter`) in `ResultsDisplay.tsx` or `AnalyticsView.tsx` to manage the active filter.
3.  **Implement Click Handler:** Add an `onClick` handler to the effort name in the results table (likely within `WodResults.tsx` or `EventsView.tsx`) to update the filter state.
4.  **Filter Data:** Update the data rendering logic (in `WodResults.tsx` or `EventsView.tsx`) to filter based on `selectedEffortFilter`.
5.  **Add Filter UI:** Create a UI element (like a chip/badge) within `ResultsDisplay.tsx` or `AnalyticsView.tsx` to show the active filter and a button to clear it.
6.  **Implement Filter Clearing:** Add functionality to the clear button to reset the `selectedEffortFilter` state.

### Summary

This plan replaces the existing "Grouped" analytics view with an interactive filtering mechanism. Users will be able to click on an exercise ('effort') in the results list to filter the view to only show entries for that specific exercise. A clear visual indicator for the active filter will be provided, along with a button to easily remove the filter. This aims to streamline the UI and provide a more direct way to analyze specific movements within a workout result. Relevant files likely include `ResultsDisplay.tsx`, `AnalyticsView.tsx`, `WodResults.tsx`, and potentially `EventsView.tsx`.

### Next Steps


### Summary
Successfully removed the 'Grouped' tab from the results display and implemented an effort-based filtering system. 

Changes:
- **TabSelector.tsx:** Removed 'Grouped' option.
- **ResultsDisplay.tsx:** Removed rendering for 'Grouped' tab, added state (`selectedEffortFilter`) to manage the active filter, passed state and setter down to `EventsView`, and added a UI element (badge with a clear 'x' button) to display and clear the current filter.
- **EventsView.tsx:** Added props to receive the filter state and setter, implemented filtering logic to only show results matching the `selectedEffortFilter`, and added an `onClick` handler to the effort name (`<td>`) to trigger the filter update.

Users can now click on an exercise name in the 'Efforts' tab to filter the list, and clear the filter using the 'x' button on the filter badge displayed at the top-right.

## 00:27 - Plan Implement Effort Summary Card
1.  Calculate aggregated metrics (sets, reps, weight, distance, avg weight/rep) for a selected effort in `ResultsDisplay.tsx`.
2.  Create a new component `EffortSummaryCard.tsx` to display these metrics.
3.  Integrate `EffortSummaryCard` into `ResultsDisplay.tsx`, replacing the placeholder.
4.  Defer implementation of "average time per rep" and "body areas diagram" as they require additional data/logic.

### Summary
Implemented the Effort Summary Card feature. When a user clicks an effort in the 'Efforts' tab, a card now displays calculated totals for sets, reps, weight volume, and distance, along with average weight per rep if applicable. This provides a quick statistical overview for the selected exercise within the workout results.

### Completed Steps
* [x] 00:27: Generated plan for Effort Summary Card.
* [x] 00:33: Calculated aggregated metrics in `ResultsDisplay.tsx`.
* [x] 00:33: Created `EffortSummaryCard.tsx` component structure.
* [x] 00:33: Implement UI for `EffortSummaryCard`.
* [x] 00:33: Integrated `EffortSummaryCard` into `ResultsDisplay.tsx`.

### Next Steps
* [ ] 00:33: (No further steps planned for this specific task unless refinements are needed).

## 00:49 - Plan Refactor EffortSummaryCard Styling & Logic

1.  **Refactor Metric Logic:** Correct unit retrieval and display for weight/distance. Handle zero reps in avg weight calculation.
2.  **Improve Layout:** Use flexbox instead of grid for better alignment/spacing.
3.  **Update Styling:** Apply softer Tailwind colors (backgrounds, borders, text, shadows).
4.  **Ensure Consistency:** Adjust padding/margins for cleanliness.

### Summary

Improve the `EffortSummaryCard` component's visual appeal and data presentation by refactoring the metric calculations, switching to a flexbox layout, and applying softer, consistent styling using Tailwind CSS.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 00:49 - Plan generated.
* [x]: 00:53 - Executed plan: Refactored `EffortSummaryCard.tsx` (logic, layout, styling).

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 00:53 - (No further steps planned for this task unless refinements are needed).

### Summary
Refactored `EffortSummaryCard.tsx` component:
- Improved metric calculation logic (handling missing data, zero reps).
- Switched layout from grid to flexbox for better alignment.
- Applied softer Tailwind CSS styling (colors, spacing, shadows).
- Added a helper function to conditionally render metrics.
The card is now more robust, visually organized, and stylistically consistent.

## 00:57 - Plan Modify EffortSummaryCard Metrics & Layout

1.  **Calculate Avg Time/Rep:** Sum span durations and divide by total reps.
2.  **Calculate Avg Wt Used:** Use existing `averageWeightPerRep` calculation.
3.  **Update Layout:** Change to a two-column grid.
4.  **Refactor Rendering:** Adjust `renderMetric` calls for the new grid layout.

### Summary

Update the `EffortSummaryCard` to display Average Time per Repetition and Average Weight Used per Repetition, replacing the previous average weight metric. Change the layout to use two columns for better presentation.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 00:57 - Plan generated.
* [x]: 00:58 - Execute plan: Updated metrics (Avg Time/Rep, Avg Wt Used/Rep) and layout (2-column grid) in `EffortSummaryCard.tsx`.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 00:58 - (No further steps planned for this task unless refinements are needed).

### Summary
Updated `EffortSummaryCard.tsx`:
- Calculated and displayed Average Time per Repetition (seconds).
- Renamed and displayed Average Weight Used per Repetition.
- Changed the metric display area to a two-column grid layout.

## 01:04 - Plan Swap Bold Style in EffortSummaryCard

1.  **Modify Styling:** In `renderMetric`, make the label `font-semibold` and the value normal weight.
2.  **Maintain Layout:** Keep `flex justify-between` for alignment.

### Summary

Adjust the styling within the `EffortSummaryCard`'s metric display to make the labels bold and the values normal weight, maintaining the existing two-column layout and alignment.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 01:04 - Plan generated.
* [x]: 01:05 - Execute plan: Swapped bold styling in `renderMetric` in `EffortSummaryCard.tsx`.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 01:05 - (No further steps planned for this task unless refinements are needed).

### Summary
Adjusted styling in `EffortSummaryCard.tsx`'s `renderMetric` function:
- Made metric labels bold (`font-semibold`).
- Made metric values normal weight (removed `font-medium`).
- Maintained consistent spacing using `flex justify-between`.
