## 13:26 - Plan: Convert Mermaid diagrams to Excalidraw

I'll convert all the Mermaid diagrams in the UI event flow architecture document to Excalidraw diagrams as requested.

1. Create necessary Excalidraw directory
2. Create Excalidraw diagram files for each of the 5 diagrams:
   - Event Flow Diagram
   - Key Event Types
   - User Input Events
   - Timer Events Processing
   - Data Structure Transformations
   - Event State Transitions
3. Update the document to reference Excalidraw diagrams instead of Mermaid
4. Save the updated document

### Summary

Converting from Mermaid syntax to Excalidraw will allow for more flexible and visually appealing diagrams within Obsidian. Excalidraw provides an interactive drawing experience with better customization options than Mermaid.

### Next Steps

* [ ]: 13:27 - Create Excalidraw folder
* [ ]: 13:28 - Create Excalidraw diagram files
* [ ]: 13:33 - Update document to reference Excalidraw diagrams
