## To Do

- [ ] ## Summary
	  Implement lap/group/roundrobin lap counters, supporting tracking and display of laps for workouts with group or round-robin structures in both runtime and UI.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Update parser and runtime types to support lap/group/roundrobin counters.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Implement lap/group/roundrobin tracking logic in Runtime (event-driven, modular).
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Update UI components (TimerDisplay, ResultsDisplay) to show lap/group/roundrobin counters and metrics.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Add metrics handling for lap/group/roundrobin in analytics and results.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Write and update documentation for new lap/group/roundrobin counter features.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Add tests for parser, runtime, and UI to validate lap/group/roundrobin logic.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Extend runtime to track lap/round state per group with correct semantics.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Implement round-robin execution logic: rotate among children each round.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Implement compose execution logic: execute all children as a set per round.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Expose lap/round counters for UI display and metrics.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Update TimerDisplay/ResultsDisplay to visualize lap/group/roundrobin counters.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Update analytics to aggregate metrics by lap/group/roundrobin.
- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Add/extend tests for visitor, runtime, and UI for these cases.


## In Progress



## Done

- [ ] 2025-04-15T01:43:12-04:00 - Analyze requirements for lap/group/roundrobin lap counting in wod.wiki syntax and runtime.
	
	
	Here is the basic idea:  And this will need to be broken down into more tasks, 
	
	if the item is indented it is grouped as a child, this is done in the visitor.  3 types of children
	
	- '-' (round-robin-operator) mean round robin each instance of the parent round goes to the next item of the list.
	- `+` (compose-operator) meaning we want to include all children as a single round
	- or a child with neither meanin each of the child will have to go though the number of rounds of the parant group.
- [x] 2025-04-15T01:50:48-04:00 - Refactor visitor to annotate StatementNodes with group type (`roundrobin`, `compose`, `repeat`) based on operator. âœ… 2025-04-15T01:51:54-04:00
