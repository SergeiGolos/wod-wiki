## 11:39 - Plan for Updating Obsidian Mermaid Configuration

1. Create a custom CSS snippet for Obsidian to make Mermaid diagrams full screen
2. Create a JavaScript file to handle the interactive functionality
3. Document the installation process for the custom CSS and JavaScript
4. Include instructions on how to enable and configure it

### Summary

Obsidian configurations are stored in the `.obsidian` directory, but as these files are gitignored, we'll create a custom CSS snippet and JavaScript file that can be manually added to Obsidian. This approach avoids modifying gitignored configuration files while still providing the full-screen Mermaid diagram functionality.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 11:39 - Identified that Obsidian config files are gitignored and not directly accessible
* [x]: 11:40 - Created a CSS snippet file for full-screen Mermaid diagrams
* [x]: 11:42 - Created a JavaScript file to handle the interactive functionality
* [x]: 11:45 - Documented how to install and enable the CSS and JavaScript files

### Installation Instructions

To make Mermaid diagrams go full screen in Obsidian, follow these steps:

#### 1. CSS Snippet Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to Settings
2. Navigate to "Appearance" ‚Üí "CSS Snippets"
3. Click the folder icon to open the snippets folder
4. Copy the `mermaid-fullscreen.css` file from `docs/Working/` to this snippets folder
5. Toggle on the snippet in Obsidian settings

#### 2. JavaScript Integration (Option 1: Custom JavaScript Plugin)

If you have the "Custom JavaScript" plugin installed:

1. Install the "Custom JavaScript" plugin from the community plugins
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí "Custom JavaScript"
3. Copy the contents of `mermaid-fullscreen.js` into a new script
4. Enable the script

#### 3. JavaScript Integration (Option 2: DataView JS)

If you have the DataView plugin:

1. Create a new note with a DataView JS code block
2. Paste the contents of `mermaid-fullscreen.js` into the code block
3. Set this note to load with Obsidian

### Usage

Once installed:

1. Any Mermaid diagram will show a small üîç icon in the corner
2. Click on any Mermaid diagram to make it go full screen
3. Click the ‚úï button or anywhere outside the diagram to exit full screen

### Note

The CSS and JavaScript files are stored in the `docs/Working` directory of the repository for reference. They need to be manually added to your Obsidian configuration as described above.
