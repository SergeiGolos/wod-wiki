## Backlog


## To Do
- ## Summary
  Improve pause/resume duration reporting in the wod.wiki runtime. Ensure that durations are always accurate, even with multiple pause/resume cycles. This involves analyzing current event flow, designing robust span aggregation, updating report logic, refactoring event handlers, comprehensive testing, and documentation updates.
- 2025-04-14T23:10:03-04:00 - Update report logic: Ensure report() and all loggers handle new span logic. Add tests for complex pause/resume scenarios.
- 2025-04-14T23:10:03-04:00 - Refactor event handlers: Update StopHandler and related handlers to ensure proper event recording.
- 2025-04-14T23:10:03-04:00 - Testing & validation: Write comprehensive unit tests for all pause/resume/report flows. Validate with real-world workout scripts.
- 2025-04-14T23:10:03-04:00 - Documentation: Update developer docs to describe the new event model and reporting logic.

## In Progress
- 2025-04-14T23:13:17-04:00 - Design robust span aggregation: Define a canonical event sequence for pause/resume and update EventSpanAggregator to handle all edge cases.

## Done

- ## Summary
  Introduce an EventSpanAggregator class to decouple timer event aggregation and block span detection from TickHandler. This will improve maintainability, enable robust analytics, and make block/span logic reusable for other features.

- 2025-04-14T23:03:30-04:00 - Create EventSpanAggregator class to process timer events and produce spans for block durations and transitions.
- 2025-04-14T23:03:30-04:00 - Refactor TickHandler to use EventSpanAggregator for elapsed time and span logic.
- 2025-04-14T23:03:30-04:00 - Add unit tests for EventSpanAggregator to ensure correct span detection and duration computation.
- 2025-04-14T23:03:30-04:00 - Document EventSpanAggregator and update related docs.

- ## Final Summary
  All tasks for the EventSpanAggregator feature have been completed:
  - EventSpanAggregator class created for event aggregation and span logic
  - TickHandler refactored to use EventSpanAggregator
  - Unit tests added and verified
  - Documentation written in docs/docs/Components/EventSpanAggregator.md

- 2025-04-14T23:11:41-04:00 - Analyze current event flow: Map out all event types and transitions (start, stop, pause, resume, etc.), and identify where event boundaries may be missed or mishandled.
