- [x] 16:56 - Enhance User-Input-Events diagram to show how user actions are translated into Runtime events ✅ 17:14
- [x] 16:56 - Update Key-Event-Types diagram to show event hierarchy and relationship to Runtime components ✅ 17:17
- [x] 16:56 - Create improved Event-Flow-Diagram showing relationships between EditorContainer, WodWiki, TimerRuntime, RunnerControls, and ResultsDisplay ✅ 17:17
- [x] 16:56 - Update Event-State-Transitions diagram to better illustrate state management in the application ✅ 17:20
- [x] 16:56 - Improve Timer-Events-Processing diagram to illustrate the Runtime component's event handling flow ✅ 17:23
- [x] 16:56 - Refine Data-Structure-Transformations diagram to show how workout scripts become executable blocks ✅ 17:23
- [x] 16:56 - ## Summary ✅ 17:25
  Plan to update all excalidraw diagrams in the UI Event Flow Architecture document to better illustrate the component relationships and event flow based on the Runtime architecture, workout syntax processing, and data structures used in wod.wiki
- ## Final Summary
  Successfully replaced all Excalidraw diagrams with detailed Mermaid flowcharts in the UI Event Flow Architecture document. The new diagrams clearly illustrate: 1) how user actions translate to Runtime events, 2) event hierarchy and relationships to Runtime components, 3) component relationships in the application, 4) state management with transitions, 5) the Runtime's event handling flow, and 6) how workout scripts are transformed into executable blocks. These improvements provide a more precise and comprehensive visualization of the wod.wiki architecture.
