## 09:33 - Analyze and Fix Results Handling
1.  **Analyze `timer.runtime.ts`:** Examine `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\timer.runtime.ts` to understand how workout results are generated, collected, and dispatched, focusing on the usage of actions related to results.
2.  **Inspect Result Action:** Review the action file responsible for handling result updates (likely `SetResultAction.ts` within `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\actions\`) to understand the data structure it expects and transmits.
3.  **Review Event Handlers:** Investigate the handler files within `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\` to identify which handlers trigger result updates (e.g., upon round completion, timer finish) and how they interact with the result action.
4.  **Examine UI Component:** Locate the UI component responsible for displaying the results table (potentially `ResultsDisplay.tsx` mentioned in memory `e1a8a0c7`, likely within `src/components/`) and analyze how it receives and processes the result action data updates.
5.  **Propose Solution:** Based on the findings, determine the necessary code changes in the runtime, handlers, actions, or UI components to ensure results are correctly pushed incrementally and reflected in the UI table.

### Summary
The investigation revealed that the `SetResultAction`, responsible for updating workout results, was unimplemented (`// TODO`). Additionally, no runtime event handlers were configured to dispatch this action. The core issue is the lack of implementation and integration for propagating results from the runtime engine to the UI update mechanism. The proposed solution involves implementing the `SetResultAction` to append results and integrating it into the relevant event handlers.

### Completed Steps
*   [x] 09:34 Step 1: Analyzed `timer.runtime.ts`. Found that the `setResults` method within `TimerRuntime` takes an array `WodResultBlock[]` and completely overwrites the internal `results` array (`this.results = results;`) before calling the `onSetResults` callback provided during initialization. This suggests that actions adding results might be replacing the entire list instead of appending.
*   [x] 09:35 Step 2: Inspected `SetResultAction.ts`. Found that `SetResultAction` currently has an empty `apply` method (`// TODO`). It doesn't actually interact with `timerRuntime.setResults` at all. This is the likely root cause of the results not updating.
*   [x] 09:35 Step 3: Reviewed Event Handlers. Found that no handlers currently create or dispatch `SetResultAction`.
*   [x] 09:54 Step 4: Integrate `SetResultAction` into `LapHandler`. Modified `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\LapHandler.ts` to create a `WodResultBlock` using the event timestamp and derive the lap number from `runtime.results.length`, then return a `new SetResultAction` with this block. (Note: This corresponds to the original plan's step 4 - examining the UI component and proposing a solution, which led to modifying LapHandler)
*   [x] 09:54 Step 5: Integrate `SetResultAction` into `EndHandler`. Modified `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\EndHandler.ts` to create a `WodResultBlock` for the final time using the event timestamp and add `new SetResultAction` to the returned actions. (Note: This corresponds to the original plan's step 5 - proposing the solution, which led to modifying EndHandler)

## 09:59 - Plan Add SetResultAction to CompleteHandler

1.  Inspect `CompleteHandler.ts`.
2.  Modify `handleEvent` to import, create, and yield `SetResultAction`.
3.  Update Worklog (this step).

### Summary

The goal is to make the `CompleteHandler` report the final workout results using a `SetResultAction` when the workout is marked as complete.

### Completed Steps

* [x]  09:59 - Log plan creation.
* [x]  10:00 - Inspected `CompleteHandler.ts`.
* [x]  10:00 - Modified `handleEvent` in `CompleteHandler.ts` to include `SetResultAction`.
