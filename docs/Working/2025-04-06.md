## 09:33 - Analyze and Fix Results Handling
1.  **Analyze `timer.runtime.ts`:** Examine `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\timer.runtime.ts` to understand how workout results are generated, collected, and dispatched, focusing on the usage of actions related to results.
2.  **Inspect Result Action:** Review the action file responsible for handling result updates (likely `SetResultAction.ts` within `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\actions\`) to understand the data structure it expects and transmits.
3.  **Review Event Handlers:** Investigate the handler files within `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\` to identify which handlers trigger result updates (e.g., upon round completion, timer finish) and how they interact with the result action.
4.  **Examine UI Component:** Locate the UI component responsible for displaying the results table (potentially `ResultsDisplay.tsx` mentioned in memory `e1a8a0c7`, likely within `src/components/`) and analyze how it receives and processes the result action data updates.
5.  **Propose Solution:** Based on the findings, determine the necessary code changes in the runtime, handlers, actions, or UI components to ensure results are correctly pushed incrementally and reflected in the UI table.

### Summary
The investigation revealed that the `SetResultAction`, responsible for updating workout results, was unimplemented (`// TODO`). Additionally, no runtime event handlers were configured to dispatch this action. The core issue is the lack of implementation and integration for propagating results from the runtime engine to the UI update mechanism. The proposed solution involves implementing the `SetResultAction` to append results and integrating it into the relevant event handlers.

### Completed Steps
*   [x] 09:34 Step 1: Analyzed `timer.runtime.ts`. Found that the `setResults` method within `TimerRuntime` takes an array `WodResultBlock[]` and completely overwrites the internal `results` array (`this.results = results;`) before calling the `onSetResults` callback provided during initialization. This suggests that actions adding results might be replacing the entire list instead of appending.
*   [x] 09:35 Step 2: Inspected `SetResultAction.ts`. Found that `SetResultAction` currently has an empty `apply` method (`// TODO`). It doesn't actually interact with `timerRuntime.setResults` at all. This is the likely root cause of the results not updating.
*   [x] 09:35 Step 3: Reviewed Event Handlers. Found that no handlers currently create or dispatch `SetResultAction`.
*   [x] 09:54 Step 4: Integrate `SetResultAction` into `LapHandler`. Modified `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\LapHandler.ts` to create a `WodResultBlock` using the event timestamp and derive the lap number from `runtime.results.length`, then return a `new SetResultAction` with this block. (Note: This corresponds to the original plan's step 4 - examining the UI component and proposing a solution, which led to modifying LapHandler)
*   [x] 09:54 Step 5: Integrate `SetResultAction` into `EndHandler`. Modified `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\handlers\EndHandler.ts` to create a `WodResultBlock` for the final time using the event timestamp and add `new SetResultAction` to the returned actions. (Note: This corresponds to the original plan's step 5 - proposing the solution, which led to modifying EndHandler)

## 09:59 - Plan Add SetResultAction to CompleteHandler

1.  Inspect `CompleteHandler.ts`.
2.  Modify `handleEvent` to import, create, and yield `SetResultAction`.
3.  Update Worklog (this step).

### Summary

The goal is to make the `CompleteHandler` report the final workout results using a `SetResultAction` when the workout is marked as complete.

### Completed Steps

* [x]  09:59 - Log plan creation.
* [x]  10:00 - Inspected `CompleteHandler.ts`.
* [x]  10:00 - Modified `handleEvent` in `CompleteHandler.ts` to include `SetResultAction`.

### Next Steps

## 10:18 - Plan Update DataTypes Docs
1. Review current data types in `src/core/timer.types.ts`.
2. Update `docs/DataTypes/Display Block.md` based on `TimerDisplayBag` and `ElapsedState`.
3. Update `docs/DataTypes/Result Block.md` based on `WodResultBlock`, `WodMetric`, `ResultSpan`, `RuntimeResult`, `RuntimeMetric`.
4. Update `docs/DataTypes/Runtime Block.md` based on `ITimerRuntime`, `IRuntimeAction`, `WodRuntimeScript`, `IRuntimeBlock`, `RuntimeEvent`, `RuntimeBlockHandler`, `RuntimeTrace`, `StatementKey`, `RuntimeState`.
5. Update `docs/DataTypes/Statement Block.md` based on `StatementNode` and `StatementFragment`.

### Summary

The goal is to synchronize the documentation in `docs/DataTypes` with the actual TypeScript interfaces and classes defined in `src/core/timer.types.ts`. This involves updating four markdown files (`Display Block.md`, `Result Block.md`, `Runtime Block.md`, `Statement Block.md`) to accurately reflect the structure and purpose of the corresponding types found in the code.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 10:18 - Plan created.
* [x]: 10:19 - Executed documentation updates for `Display Block.md`, `Result Block.md`, `Runtime Block.md`, and `Statement Block.md`.
        
### Next Steps



### Execution Summary
Successfully updated the four documentation files in `docs/DataTypes` to align with the current type definitions in `src/core/timer.types.ts`. Key types like `TimerDisplayBag`, `ElapsedState`, `WodResultBlock`, `WodMetric`, `ITimerRuntime`, `IRuntimeBlock`, `StatementNode`, and `StatementFragment` are now correctly documented.

## 10:26 - Plan Revise Display Block Docs
1. Review `docs/DataTypes/Display Block.md` for sections not directly based on `TimerDisplayBag` or `ElapsedState` types.
2. Remove speculative sections (Display States, Hierarchy, Color Coding, Interactions, Accessibility, Responsive Design, Future Enhancements).
3. Ensure the remaining content accurately describes only the `TimerDisplayBag` and `ElapsedState` interfaces from `src/core/timer.types.ts`.

### Summary

The current `Display Block.md` documentation contains descriptions of UI behavior and features that are not directly reflected in the core data types (`TimerDisplayBag`, `ElapsedState`). This plan aims to remove that speculative content, focusing the document solely on defining the data structures as they exist in the code.

### Completed Steps

* [x]: 10:26 - Plan created.
* [x]: 10:26 - Executed revision of `Display Block.md`, removing speculative UI/UX content.

### Next Steps



### Execution Summary
Revised `docs/DataTypes/Display Block.md` to focus strictly on the definitions and explanations of the `TimerDisplayBag` and `ElapsedState` interfaces as found in `src/core/timer.types.ts`. Removed sections describing potential UI states, interactions, and features not directly represented by these data structures.

## 23:35 - Plan Build ResultMetric Objects
1.  Find the definition or usage of `ResultMetric` to understand its structure.
2.  Modify `RuntimeJit.compile` in `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\RuntimeJit.ts` to map data from `efforts`, `rounds`, `repetitions`, and `resistance` fragments into `ResultMetric` objects.
3.  Log the implementation details.

### Summary

This plan outlines the steps to create `ResultMetric` instances within the `RuntimeJit.compile` method by utilizing the already parsed workout fragments (effort, rounds, reps, resistance).

### Completed Steps

* [x] 23:35 - Plan created.

### Next Steps

* [ ] 23:35 - Find `ResultMetric` definition/usage.

## 23:58 - Plan Update Result Components for ResultSpan[]
1.  Update `ResultsDisplay.tsx` props and internal logic to accept `ResultSpan[]` instead of `WodResultBlock`. Adapt rendering to display data from the new format.
2.  Update `WodResults.tsx` props to accept `ResultSpan[]`. Adjust how it processes and potentially passes this data to child components like `WodTable`.
3.  Update `WodTable.tsx` props to accept `ResultSpan[]`. Modify the table structure (columns, rows) to correctly display information from the `ResultSpan` objects, including iterating over the `metrics` array within each span.

### Summary

The goal is to refactor the analytics components (`ResultsDisplay`, `WodResults`, `WodTable`) to use the new `ResultSpan[]` data structure for displaying workout results, replacing the previous `WodResultBlock` implementation. This involves updating component props, type definitions (if local), and data mapping/rendering logic to align with the `ResultSpan` schema, particularly handling the nested `metrics` array.

### Completed Steps

*   [x]: 23:58 - Plan created.
*   [x]: 00:00 - Updated `ResultsDisplay.tsx` to use ResultSpan[] instead of WodResultBlock[].
*   [x]: 00:00 - Updated `WodResults.tsx` to use ResultSpan[] and implemented grouping by blockKey.
*   [x]: 00:00 - Updated `WodTable.tsx` to use ResultSpan[] and display metrics from each result span.

### Next Steps

*   [x]: 00:00 - All tasks completed.
