**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a system that generates and processes runtime scripts (referred to as "WOD Runtime Scripts") within a visitor pattern. The system focuses on representing these scripts as objects with varying levels of detail and enabling event-driven processing, including handling user interactions like button events.

**2. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goals of this system are to:

- **Generate WOD Runtime Scripts:** Create runtime scripts dynamically using a visitor pattern.
- **Represent Runtime Scripts Effectively:** Provide multiple object representations of the runtime script to optimize for different use cases, including:
    - Lightweight representation for linking to leaf objects.
    - Full, in-memory representation for detailed processing and stack navigation.
- **Enable Event-Driven Runtime Processing:** Implement a mechanism for processing runtime scripts based on events that propagate up a hierarchical structure.
- **Handle User Interaction:** Allow runtime objects to respond to user-initiated events, specifically button "select triggers."

**3. Functional Requirements**

This section describes the specific functionalities the system must provide.

**3.1. WOD Runtime Script Generation**

- **FR.1. Visitor-Based Generation:** The generation of the WOD Runtime Script **shall** be performed within a visitor pattern.
- **FR.2. Visitor Output:** The visitor **shall** return an object representing the generated WOD Runtime Script upon completion.
- **FR.3. Script Representation - Link to Leaf Objects:** The returned script object **shall** include a representation that is a link or reference to the individual leaf objects that comprise the script. This representation is intended to be lightweight.
- **FR.4. Script Representation - Full Stack Objects:** The returned script object **shall** also include a full representation of the script as stack objects. This representation **shall** reside in memory and **shall** allow for referencing and traversing the parent stack structure.

**3.2. Runtime Block Creation and Structure**

- **FR.5. Runtime Block from Script:** The system **shall** be able to create a runtime block from a generated WOD Runtime Script.
- **FR.6. Runtime Block Representation:** A runtime block **shall** be represented by an instance of a "leaf" object.
- **FR.7. Runtime Block Parent Structure:** The runtime block (leaf instance) **shall** contain the data structure that represents all its parent nodes within the runtime script hierarchy.

**3.3. Ontic Event Processing and Event Propagation**

- **FR.8. Ontic Event Processing:** The system **shall** implement an "ontic event" mechanism to process the runtime block.
- **FR.9. Tree Traversal:** The ontic event processing **shall** walk up the tree structure of the runtime block, starting from the leaf.
- **FR.10. Leaf-Initiated Events:** When a leaf processes an event, it **shall** be able to generate behavior events that represent its actions or state changes. These events **shall** propagate upwards towards the parent.
- **FR.11. Parent Event Handling:** Parent nodes **shall** receive events propagated from their children (leafs or lower-level parents).
- **FR.12. Parent Behavior and Event Generation:** Upon receiving an event, a parent node **shall** be able to:
    - Determine if any behavior needs to be applied based on the received event.
    - Generate new behavior events as a result of its processing.
    - Propagate generated events further upwards to its own parent.
- **FR.13. Event Chaining:** The event processing mechanism **shall** support chaining of events up the parent hierarchy, allowing events to trigger responses at multiple levels.

**3.4. Button Event Handling (Select Triggers)**

- **FR.14. Button Event Application:** The event processing mechanism **shall** also apply to button events (or similar user input triggers).
- **FR.15. Runtime Object Responsiveness:** Individual runtime objects (including leafs and potentially parents) **shall** be able to understand and respond to defined "select triggers" originating from button events.
- **FR.16. Select Trigger Definition:** The system **shall** allow for the definition of "select triggers" that runtime objects can recognize.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **NF.1. Performance:** The system **should** process ontic events and button events in a timely manner to ensure responsiveness. (This will need to be further defined with specific performance metrics if necessary).
- **NF.2. Memory Management:** The system **should** manage memory efficiently, particularly regarding the full representation of the runtime script, to avoid excessive memory consumption. (Again, specific memory usage limits might be needed).
- **NF.3. Maintainability:** The code **should** be well-structured and documented to facilitate future maintenance and modifications.
- **NF.4. Clarity of Representation:** The two representations of the runtime script (link to leaf objects and full stack objects) **should** be clearly distinguishable and their intended use cases well-documented.

**5. Data Requirements (Implicit)**

- **DR.1. WOD Runtime Script Data Structure:** The system requires a defined data structure for representing WOD Runtime Scripts, including leaf objects, stack objects, and parent-child relationships.
- **DR.2. Event Data Structure:** The system requires a data structure for representing events, including event type, source, and potentially event-specific data.
- **DR.3. Select Trigger Definitions:** The system needs a mechanism to store and manage definitions for "select triggers."

**6. Interface Requirements**

- **UI.1. Button Event Input:** The system needs an interface to receive button events or equivalent user input that can be interpreted as "select triggers." (The specifics of this interface will depend on the context of the system - e.g., hardware buttons, UI elements).
- **API.1. Visitor Interface:** The system needs a defined interface for the visitor to generate the WOD Runtime Script and return the script object with its different representations.
- **API.2. Runtime Block Creation Interface:** An interface is needed to create runtime blocks from WOD Runtime Scripts.
- **API.3. Event Processing Interface:** The system needs an interface to initiate and manage the "ontic event" processing.

**7. Constraints (If Applicable)**

- _(At this stage, no constraints are explicitly mentioned in the provided text. In a real project, you might have constraints related to technology stack, libraries, performance targets, development time, etc.)_

**8. Glossary**

- **WOD Runtime Script:** The runtime script being generated and processed by the system.
- **Visitor:** A design pattern element used to generate the WOD Runtime Script.
- **Leaf Object:** A fundamental building block of the WOD Runtime Script, representing a runtime block.
- **Stack Object:** Objects representing the parent nodes in the runtime script hierarchy.
- **Ontic Event:** The type of event used to process the runtime block and trigger behaviors.
- **Runtime Block:** An instance created from a runtime script, represented by a leaf object and containing the parent structure.
- **Select Trigger:** A user-initiated event, typically from a button press or similar interaction, that runtime objects can respond to.

**Next Steps:**

- **Review and Clarification:** This document needs to be reviewed and clarified with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Elaboration:** Each requirement needs to be elaborated upon with more detail if necessary.
- **Prioritization:** Prioritize requirements based on project goals and constraints.
- **Traceability:** Establish traceability between requirements and design/implementation.
- **Verification and Validation:** Define how each requirement will be verified and validated.
