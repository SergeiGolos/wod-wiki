# WOD Wiki Runtime Interfaces Deep Dive: From Markdown to Analytics Collection

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the WOD Wiki runtime architecture, tracing the complete data transformation workflow from markdown workout definitions to analytics collection. The system employs a sophisticated multi-layered architecture featuring a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, strategy pattern-based block compilation, stack-based execution, and event-driven analytics collection. The design prioritizes type safety, performance optimization, and extensibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns across all transformation phases.

## Introduction and Architecture Overview

The WOD Wiki runtime system represents a highly structured approach to workout definition parsing, compilation, and execution. At its core, the system transforms human-readable markdown workout definitions into executable runtime blocks that collect performance analytics during execution. This transformation occurs through distinct phases: lexical analysis, parsing, compilation, execution, and analytics collection.

The architecture is built around several key design principles:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure compile-time validation of all data structures and operations
- **Performance**: Stack-based execution with sub-millisecond operation targets for critical paths
- **Extensibility**: Strategy pattern enables easy addition of new workout types and compilation approaches
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between parsing, compilation, execution, and analytics collection
- **Resource Management**: Constructor-based initialization with consumer-managed disposal patterns

## Core Runtime Interfaces and Architecture

### IRuntimeBlock Interface: The Executable Contract

The `IRuntimeBlock` interface (`src/runtime/IRuntimeBlock.ts`) serves as the fundamental contract for all executable runtime blocks. This interface defines the lifecycle management pattern that governs block execution within the runtime stack.

**Key Properties:**
- `key: BlockKey` - Unique identifier for block tracking and debugging
- `sourceIds: number[]` - Array of source code statement IDs for mapping runtime blocks to original markdown
- `blockType?: string` - Optional type discriminator used by UI components for display purposes

**Lifecycle Methods:**
The interface implements a behavior-based lifecycle pattern with four critical phases:

1. **mount(runtime: IScriptRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]** - Called when a block is pushed to the execution stack. Initializes block state and returns initial actions to be processed by the runtime.

2. **next(runtime: IScriptRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]** - Called when child blocks complete execution. Enables parent blocks to respond to child completion events and coordinate complex workout structures.

3. **unmount(runtime: IScriptRuntime): IRuntimeAction[]** - Called when a block is popped from the stack. Handles cleanup and returns final actions before block disposal.

4. **dispose(runtime: IScriptRuntime): void** - Resource cleanup method that must be called by consumers after popping blocks. Implements multiple-call safety for robust resource management.

**Lifecycle Pattern Characteristics:**
- **Constructor-based initialization**: Blocks initialize during construction, not when pushed to stack
- **Consumer-managed disposal**: When popping blocks, consumer must call `dispose()` to prevent memory leaks
- **Performance targets**: push/pop operations < 1ms, current() access < 0.1ms, dispose() < 50ms

### IScriptRuntime Interface: Central Orchestration Hub

The `IScriptRuntime` interface (`src/runtime/IScriptRuntime.ts`) represents the central runtime context that orchestrates all execution activities. It serves as the primary entry point for event handling and coordinates interactions between all runtime subsystems.

**Core Components:**
- `script: WodScript` - Parsed workout definition containing all statements and hierarchical relationships
- `memory: IRuntimeMemory` - Independent memory management system separate from execution flow for debugging capabilities
- `stack: RuntimeStack` - Stack-based execution environment managing active blocks
- `jit: JitCompiler` - Just-in-time compiler for transforming parsed statements into executable blocks
- `errors?: RuntimeError[]` - Error collection system for tracking and debugging execution issues
- `metrics?: IMetricCollector` - Analytics subsystem for performance data collection

**Primary Method:**
`handle(event: IEvent): void` - The main event handling entry point that processes runtime events and coordinates block lifecycle management.

### IRuntimeMemory Interface: Independent State Management

The `IRuntimeMemory` interface (`src/runtime/IRuntimeMemory.ts`) provides an independent memory management system designed to enable debugging and state inspection separate from execution flow. This separation allows for comprehensive state tracking without impacting execution performance.

**Memory Allocation and Management:**
```typescript
allocate<T>(type: string, ownerId: string, initialValue?: T, visibility?: 'public' | 'private')
```
Allocates typed memory with optional visibility controls. Supports both public and private memory spaces for different debugging and analytics needs.

**Value Access Patterns:**
```typescript
get<T>(reference: TypedMemoryReference<T>): T | undefined
set<T>(reference: TypedMemoryReference<T>, value: T)
```
Type-safe value retrieval and setting with reference-based access patterns.

**Memory Search and Cleanup:**
```typescript
search(criteria: MemorySearchCriteria): IMemoryReference[]
release(reference: IMemoryReference): void
```
Advanced search capabilities for debugging and automatic resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

## JIT Compiler System and Strategy Pattern Implementation

### JitCompiler Class: Central Compilation Engine

The `JitCompiler` class (`src/runtime/JitCompiler.ts`) serves as the central compilation engine responsible for transforming parsed workout statements into executable runtime blocks. The compiler implements a two-phase compilation process with sophisticated metric inheritance and strategy coordination.

**Core Compilation Method:**
```typescript
compile(nodes: CodeStatement[], runtime: IScriptRuntime, context?: CompilationContext): IRuntimeBlock | undefined
```

The compilation process follows these phases:

1. **Strategy Matching**: Iterates through registered `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` implementations to find the appropriate compilation strategy based on statement characteristics
2. **Block Compilation**: Delegates to the selected strategy for actual block creation
3. **Metric Inheritance**: Propagates metrics from parent statements to child blocks
4. **Context Integration**: Integrates compiled blocks into the runtime context with proper memory allocation and state initialization

### IRuntimeBlockStrategy Interface: Extensible Compilation Pattern

The `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` interface (`src/runtime/IRuntimeBlockStrategy.ts`) implements the strategy pattern for block compilation, enabling extensible support for different workout types and compilation approaches.

**Strategy Contract:**
```typescript
interface IRuntimeBlockStrategy {
  match(statements: ICodeStatement[], runtime: IScriptRuntime): boolean
  compile(statements: ICodeStatement[], runtime: IScriptRuntime, context?: CompilationContext): IRuntimeBlock
}
```

**Strategy Implementations and Precedence Order:**
The system includes six strategy implementations with strict precedence ordering:

1. **TimeBoundRoundsStrategy** - AMRAP workouts (Timer + Rounds/AMRAP fragments)
2. **IntervalStrategy** - EMOM workouts (Timer + Action="EMOM")
3. **TimerStrategy** - Time-bound workouts (Timer fragments present)
4. **RoundsStrategy** - Multi-round workouts (Rounds fragments, no Timer precedence)
5. **GroupStrategy** - Hierarchical/grouped exercises
6. **EffortStrategy** - Simple effort-based workouts (no timer/rounds)

This precedence order ensures that more specific workout types are matched before general patterns, with time-bound rounds taking highest priority and simple effort-based workouts serving as the fallback strategy.

## Parser System and Text Transformation Workflows

### Multi-Phase Parsing Architecture

The parser system implements a comprehensive three-phase transformation process that converts raw markdown text into structured Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) suitable for compilation.

**Phase 1: Lexical Analysis**
- **Tokenizer**: `MdTimerLexer` (Chevrotain-based) converts markdown text into token stream
- **Token Types**: Duration, Rep, Resistance, Distance, Effort, Rounds, and structural tokens
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive token-level error detection and reporting

**Phase 2: Syntax Analysis**
- **Parser**: `MdTimerParse` (Chevrotain CST parser) builds Concrete Syntax Trees from token streams
- **Grammar Rules**: Comprehensive grammar supporting all workout syntax constructs
- **Validation**: Syntax validation with detailed error positioning

**Phase 3: Semantic Analysis**
- **Visitor**: `MdTimerInterpreter` (AST visitor pattern) transforms CST into semantic AST
- **Semantic Validation**: Type checking, fragment validation, and relationship verification
- **Metadata Preservation**: Source location tracking throughout transformation pipeline

### Core Parser Interfaces

#### ICodeStatement Interface: Parsed Statement Representation

The `ICodeStatement` interface (`src/CodeStatement.ts`) represents parsed workout statements with full hierarchical relationship tracking and source mapping.

**Structural Properties:**
- `id: number` - Unique statement identifier for cross-referencing
- `parent?: number` - Parent statement reference for hierarchical navigation
- `children: number[][]` - Multi-dimensional child grouping for complex workout structures
- `fragments: ICodeFragment[]` - Associated workout metric fragments
- `isLeaf?: boolean` - Leaf node detection for traversal optimization
- `meta: CodeMetadata` - Comprehensive source location metadata

#### ICodeFragment Interface: Individual Workout Components

The `ICodeFragment` interface (`src/CodeFragment.ts`) represents individual workout metric fragments with specialized type handling and value transformation.

**Fragment Types and Specializations:**
- **TimerFragment**: Time duration parsing (days:hours:minutes:seconds → milliseconds)
- **RepFragment**: Repetition counting with numeric validation
- **EffortFragment**: Exercise name and description handling with semantic validation
- **ActionFragment**: Special action parsing (EMOM, AMRAP, etc.) with keyword recognition
- **DistanceFragment**: Distance measurements with unit conversion
- **ResistanceFragment**: Weight/resistance values with multiple unit support
- **RoundsFragment**: Round grouping and sequencing logic
- **LapFragment**: Grouping operations (compose+, round-, repeat) with hierarchical composition

**Fragment Metadata System:**
The `CodeMetadata` class (`src/CodeMetadata.ts`) provides comprehensive source code location tracking essential for debugging and analytics mapping:

```typescript
interface CodeMetadata {
  line: number
  startOffset: number
  endOffset: number
  columnStart: number
  columnEnd: number
  length: number
}
```

## Fragment System and Type Hierarchy

### Fragment Type System Architecture

The fragment system implements a sophisticated type hierarchy that enables precise representation of workout metrics with automatic value transformation and validation.

**TimerFragment Implementation:**
Handles complex time duration parsing with support for multiple time unit formats:
- Input examples: "20:00", "1:30:00", "2 days, 3 hours, 45 minutes"
- Output: Standardized millisecond values for runtime calculations
- Validation: Comprehensive time format validation with error positioning

**RepFragment Implementation:**
Provides repetition counting with numeric validation and range checking:
- Input formats: "10 reps", "15", "5x3" (sets × reps)
- Output: Integer values for runtime counting
- Validation: Numeric range validation and reasonableness checks

**EffortFragment Implementation:**
Manages exercise identification with semantic validation and database integration:
- Input: Exercise names and descriptions
- Output: Normalized exercise identifiers
- Integration: Exercise database searching and suggestion engine integration

**Composite Fragment Operations:**
The system supports composite operations through specialized fragment types:
- **LapFragment with compose+**: Hierarchical exercise composition
- **LapFragment with round-**: Round-based grouping and sequencing
- **LapFragment with repeat**: Repetition-based workout structure creation

### Fragment Metadata and Source Mapping

All fragments maintain comprehensive source mapping through the `CodeMetadata` system, enabling:
- Precise error positioning in editor interfaces
- Analytics mapping from runtime metrics back to source statements
- Debugging visualization with source-highlighting
- Performance analysis with source-correlation

## Runtime Stack Operations and Execution Management

### RuntimeStack Class: High-Performance Execution Environment

The `RuntimeStack` class (`src/runtime/RuntimeStack.ts`) implements a high-performance stack-based execution environment optimized for sub-millisecond operation times.

**Stack Structure and Operations:**
```typescript
class RuntimeStack {
  readonly blocks: readonly IRuntimeBlock[]  // Current stack (top-first)
  readonly current: IRuntimeBlock | undefined  // Active (top) block
  readonly keys: BlockKey[]  // Block identifiers for debugging

  push(block: IRuntimeBlock): void  // Simple push, no initialization calls
  pop(): IRuntimeBlock | undefined  // Simple pop, no cleanup calls
  graph(): IRuntimeBlock[]  // Stack visualization for debugging
}
```

**Performance Optimization:**
The stack is designed for extreme performance with specific targets:
- **push/pop operations**: < 1ms for fast workout transitions
- **current() access**: < 0.1ms for frequent state queries
- **dispose() operations**: < 50ms for resource cleanup

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Simple Operations**: Stack operations are intentionally simple without lifecycle management calls
- **Consumer Responsibility**: Lifecycle management (mount/unmount/dispose) is handled by consumers
- **Immutability**: Read-only access patterns prevent accidental state corruption

### Block Lifecycle Management

The runtime implements a sophisticated block lifecycle management system that coordinates state transitions across multiple execution phases:

**1. Block Creation and Initialization:**
- Blocks are created through JIT compiler strategies
- Constructor-based initialization sets up initial state
- Memory allocation occurs during construction phase

**2. Stack Integration:**
- `push(block)` adds block to execution stack
- `mount(runtime)` initializes block execution state
- Event emission coordinates with runtime context

**3. Execution Coordination:**
- Behavior-based state management handles complex workout logic
- Metric collection occurs throughout execution phase
- Event-driven architecture enables responsive execution

**4. Stack Removal and Cleanup:**
- `pop()` removes block from execution stack
- `unmount(runtime)` handles final state transitions
- `dispose(runtime)` performs resource cleanup (consumer-managed)

## Analytics Collection and Performance Metrics System

### MetricCollector Interface: Standardized Performance Data Collection

The `IMetricCollector` interface (`src/runtime/MetricCollector.ts`) provides a standardized system for collecting workout performance metrics with type safety and extensibility.

**Core Collection Methods:**
```typescript
interface IMetricCollector {
  collect(metric: RuntimeMetric): void  // Add performance metric to collection
  getMetrics(): RuntimeMetric[]  // Retrieve all collected metrics
  clear(): void  // Reset collection state for new workout sessions
}
```

**Collection Characteristics:**
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures metric validity and consistency
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-frequency metric collection during workout execution
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom metric types and collection strategies
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive metric metadata for performance analysis

### RuntimeMetric Interface: Structured Performance Data

The `RuntimeMetric` interface (`src/runtime/RuntimeMetric.ts`) defines the standardized format for all performance metrics collected during workout execution.

**Metric Structure:**
```typescript
interface RuntimeMetric {
  exerciseId: string  // Source exercise identifier for traceability
  values: MetricValue[]  // Performance values (reps, time, distance, etc.)
  timeSpans: TimeSpan[]  // Temporal data for when values were recorded
}
```

**Metric Value Types and Semantics:**
The system supports nine distinct metric value types with specific semantic meanings:

1. **repetitions**: Count-based metrics for strength exercises (e.g., "10 pushups")
2. **resistance**: Weight/load metrics for strength training (e.g., "135 lb squat")
3. **distance**: Distance measurements for cardio activities (e.g., "5km run")
4. **timestamp**: Time-based metrics for performance tracking (e.g., "completed at 10:30")
5. **rounds**: Round completion metrics for structured workouts (e.g., "round 3 of 5")
6. **time**: Duration measurements for time-based activities (e.g., "45 seconds")
7. **calories**: Energy expenditure metrics (e.g., "250 calories burned")
8. **action**: Action completion metrics for workout steps (e.g., "warmup completed")
9. **effort**: Intensity/effort metrics for subjective performance (e.g., "RPE 8")

**Temporal Data Management:**
Each metric includes comprehensive temporal data through the `TimeSpan` system:
- **startTimestamp**: When the metric recording began
- **endTimestamp**: When the metric recording completed
- **duration**: Total time spent collecting the metric
- **metadata**: Additional temporal context for analysis
