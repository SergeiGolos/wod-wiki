## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should the three visualization panels (fragments, runtime stack, memory) be arranged spatially? ‚Üí A: Make them enableable from the Controls panel with a on/off toggle switch, and display them vertically
- Q: What is the acceptable update latency for visualization panels to reflect script changes? ‚Üí A: For the new fragments panel update event should be watching the updated event on the editor
- Q: Should the fragment visualization component reuse the existing `FragmentVisualizer` and `getFragmentColorClasses` from `Parser.tsx`, or should it duplicate this logic? ‚Üí A: Extract to shared - Move to a shared module, both stories use it
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable visual delay for highlight transitions? ‚Üí A: Acceptable (50-100ms) - Noticeable but not disruptive
- Q: When a script contains parsing errors or is invalid, should the fragment visualization panel show an error state, or should it display the last successfully parsed fragments? ‚Üí A: Show error state - Display error message, clear previous fragments

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer learning about the WOD Wiki compilation process, I want to see a unified visualization that shows how workout scripts are parsed into fragments, compiled into runtime blocks, and allocated in memory, so I can understand the complete compilation pipeline from source to execution.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a JIT Compiler Demo is opened, **When** a user views the interface, **Then** the display shows a Controls panel with toggle switches for each visualization panel (fragments, runtime stack, memory allocations), arranged vertically when enabled

2. **Given** a workout script is entered in the editor, **When** the editor's update event fires, **Then** fragments are re-parsed and displayed with color-coded type indicators (timer, rep, effort, distance, rounds, action, increment, lap, text, resistance)

3. **Given** fragments are displayed, **When** a user examines a fragment group, **Then** the fragment shows its type name, and individual fragment values in a visually grouped format

4. **Given** the runtime stack is displayed, **When** a user hovers over a runtime block, **Then** associated memory allocations are highlighted and the corresponding source code line is indicated

5. **Given** memory allocations are displayed, **When** a user hovers over a memory entry, **Then** the owning runtime block is highlighted in the stack view

6. **Given** the demo is being used, **When** a user looks for debug harness controls, **Then** no debug-specific controls or sections are present in the interface

7. **Given** an invalid workout script is entered, **When** parsing fails, **Then** the fragment panel displays an error message and clears any previously displayed fragments

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a script contains no fragments (empty or invalid)? Display should show error state with message, clearing any previous fragments
- How does the system handle very long workout scripts with many fragments? Fragments should be scrollable while maintaining visual hierarchy
- What happens when hovering quickly between multiple blocks? Highlights should update within 50-100ms without flicker (noticeable but not disruptive)
- How does the system display fragments with very long text values? Text should be truncated with ellipsis and full value shown on hover/tooltip
- What happens when parsing fails mid-edit? Fragment panel immediately shows error state rather than retaining stale fragments

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Controls Panel**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Controls panel with toggle switches for each visualization panel
- **FR-002**: Each toggle switch MUST enable/disable its corresponding visualization panel (fragments, runtime stack, memory allocations)
- **FR-003**: Visualization panels MUST be arranged vertically when enabled
- **FR-004**: Toggle states MUST persist during the user session

**Fragment Visualization**
- **FR-005**: System MUST display parsed fragments grouped by type (timer, rep, effort, distance, rounds, action, increment, lap, text, resistance)
- **FR-006**: System MUST use distinct color coding for each fragment type matching the parser story color scheme
- **FR-007**: Fragment visualization components MUST be extracted to a shared module for reuse across parser and compiler stories
- **FR-008**: Each fragment group MUST display the fragment type name as a header
- **FR-009**: Each fragment MUST display its value in a readable format within its group
- **FR-010**: Fragment display MUST maintain visual hierarchy showing the structure of the parsed script
- **FR-011**: When parsing fails, fragment panel MUST display an error state with message and clear any previous fragments

**Runtime Stack Visualization**
- **FR-012**: System MUST display the runtime stack with blocks organized from root to current
- **FR-013**: System MUST visually indicate the currently active block in the stack
- **FR-014**: Stack blocks MUST show their depth through visual indentation or hierarchy markers
- **FR-015**: System MUST support hovering on runtime blocks to trigger highlighting interactions

**Memory Allocation Visualization**
- **FR-016**: System MUST display memory allocations grouped by owning runtime block
- **FR-017**: Each memory entry MUST show its type, value, and validation status
- **FR-018**: System MUST support hovering on memory entries to trigger highlighting interactions

**Interactive Highlighting**
- **FR-019**: System MUST highlight associated memory allocations when a runtime block is hovered
- **FR-020**: System MUST highlight the owning runtime block when a memory allocation is hovered
- **FR-021**: System MUST indicate the corresponding source code line when hovering over runtime blocks
- **FR-022**: Highlighting MUST be visually distinct and clear without obscuring content
- **FR-023**: Highlight transitions MUST complete within 50-100ms to avoid disruptive lag

**Interface Cleanup**
- **FR-024**: System MUST NOT display any debug harness features or controls
- **FR-025**: System MUST NOT include debug-specific sections in the interface
- **FR-026**: The interface MUST focus exclusively on visualization of fragments, runtime stack, and memory allocations (controlled via Controls panel toggles)

**Editor Integration**
- **FR-027**: System MUST display a workout script editor that updates visualizations in near real-time
- **FR-028**: Fragment visualization panel MUST update by watching the editor's update event (within 300ms of changes)
- **FR-029**: System MUST support editing workout scripts and reflecting changes in all enabled visualization panels
- **FR-030**: Editor MUST highlight lines corresponding to hovered runtime blocks

### Key Entities

- **Fragment**: A parsed element of a workout script with a specific type (timer, rep, effort, etc.), value, and source image text. Fragments represent the atomic units of workout syntax.

- **Fragment Type**: A classification category for fragments (timer, rep, effort, distance, rounds, action, increment, lap, text, resistance) that determines visual styling and semantic meaning.

- **Runtime Block**: A compiled unit of execution in the runtime stack with a type (Root, Timer, Effort, Group, Completion, Idle), depth level, associated metrics, and reference to source line.

- **Memory Allocation**: A memory entry in the runtime memory space with an owner (runtime block), type, value, validation status, and potential child allocations.

- **Visualization Panel**: A distinct section of the interface showing one aspect of the compilation process (fragments, runtime stack, or memory allocations). Panels are toggleable via Controls panel and displayed vertically when enabled.

- **Controls Panel**: An interface section containing toggle switches that enable/disable individual visualization panels, allowing users to customize which aspects of the compilation process they want to view.
