# Feature Specification: Next Button Integration for Workout Script Execution

**Feature Branch**: `004-specs-research-next`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What type of visual feedback should the system provide when users reach the end of a workout script and click the Next button? ‚Üí A: Disable the Next button with subtle styling (grayed out, reduced opacity)
- Q: Should the system prioritize accurate event timestamps over processing speed for handler calculations? ‚Üí A: Yes, prioritize timestamp accuracy for all handler calculations
- Q: How should the system handle repeated rapid clicks on the Next button? ‚Üí A: Queue clicks and process sequentially
- Q: When the system encounters an error during execution advancement, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Stop execution and display error message, allow retry
- Q: What constitutes an "invalid runtime state" that should prevent execution advancement? ‚Üí A: Any of the above conditions (no active script, memory corruption, previous failure)

**Input**: User description: "@specs\research\next-button-integration-analysis.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Analysis document provides detailed technical requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: Next button functionality, event-driven execution, runtime progression
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define user interactions and expected behaviors
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Event system, runtime state, user interface
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user exploring workout script demonstrations in Storybook, I want to advance through script execution step-by-step using a Next button, so I can understand how the runtime system processes workout blocks sequentially.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a workout script is loaded in the Storybook runtime demo, **When** I click the "Next Block" button, **Then** the script execution advances by exactly one step and the UI displays the updated state.

2. **Given** I am at the end of a workout script, **When** I click the "Next Block" button, **Then** the system gracefully handles the boundary condition and provides appropriate feedback.

3. **Given** multiple handlers are registered for execution events, **When** I click the "Next Block" button, **Then** all relevant handlers process the event in the correct sequence.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system encounters an error during execution advancement?
- How does the system handle repeated rapid clicks on the Next button?
- What occurs when the runtime system is in an invalid state?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to advance workout script execution by one step through a Next button interface.
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain consistent execution state between Next button interactions.
- **FR-003**: System MUST process execution advancement events through an event-driven architecture.
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the user interface to reflect current execution state after each Next action.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle script completion boundaries gracefully when no more execution steps are available.
- **FR-006**: System MUST disable the Next button with subtle styling (grayed out, reduced opacity) when no more execution steps are available.
- **FR-007**: System MUST execute all relevant handlers in the correct sequence during advancement.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent execution advancement when runtime has no active script loaded, memory corruption detected, or previous execution failed without recovery.
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize accurate event timestamps for all handler calculations over processing speed.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain memory integrity during repeated execution advancements.
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure all execution events carry accurate timestamps for handler calculations.
- **FR-012**: System MUST queue repeated rapid clicks on the Next button and process them sequentially.
- **FR-013**: System MUST stop execution and display error message when encountering errors, allowing user to retry.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Execution Event**: Represents a user-triggered advancement request that propagates through the runtime system.
- **Execution State**: Current position and context within the workout script being executed.
- **Runtime Handler**: Components that process execution events and determine next actions.
- **User Interface State**: Visual representation of the current execution status.
