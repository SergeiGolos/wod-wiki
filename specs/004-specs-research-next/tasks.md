# Tasks: Next Button Integration for Workout Script Execution

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-specs-research-next/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Storybook, Vitest
   → ✅ Libraries: Chevrotain parser, Monaco Editor
   → ✅ Structure: Single project (src/, tests/)
2. Load design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: NextEvent, NextEventHandler, NextAction entities
   → ✅ contracts/: IEvent.md, IEventHandler.md, IRuntimeAction.md
   → ✅ research.md: Implementation requirements and edge cases
   → ✅ quickstart.md: Test scenarios and validation steps
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Project structure verification, dependencies check
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests, unit tests
   → Core: Event, Handler, Action implementations
   → Integration: Storybook component update, UI state management
   → Polish: Performance validation, documentation updates
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have models
   → ✅ All integration points covered
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Verify existing project structure matches implementation plan

- [ ] T003 [P] Check existing linting and formatting configuration

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

### Contract Tests
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test NextEvent creation and properties in tests/runtime/NextEvent.test.ts
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test NextEventHandler event processing in tests/runtime/NextEventHandler.test.ts

### Unit Tests (Implementation-specific)
- [ ] T011 [P] Unit test JitCompilerDemo Next button handler in tests/stories/JitCompilerDemo.test.tsx

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Event System Components
- [ ] T012 [P] Create NextEvent class in src/runtime/NextEvent.ts
- [ ] T013 [P] Create NextEventHandler class in src/runtime/NextEventHandler.ts
- [ ] T014 [P] Create NextAction class in src/runtime/NextAction.ts

### Integration Implementation
- [ ] T015 Update JitCompilerDemo Next button handler in stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx
- [ ] T016 Add click queuing mechanism to JitCompilerDemo in stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx
- [ ] T017 Add error state handling to JitCompilerDemo in stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx
- [ ] T018 Add script completion detection to JitCompilerDemo in stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx

### Handler Registration (Block-specific)
- [ ] T019 Add next handler registration to relevant runtime blocks
- [ ] T020 Implement handleNext method in relevant runtime blocks
- [ ] T021 Add handler cleanup in block disposal methods

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T022 Test Next button functionality in Storybook runtime stories
- [ ] T023 Validate UI state updates after execution advancement
- [ ] T024 Test button state transitions (normal, disabled, error)
- [ ] T025 Verify memory integrity during repeated operations
- [ ] T026 Test performance targets (<50ms events, <100ms UI)

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T027 [P] Add comprehensive error logging and debugging information
- [ ] T028 [P] Update Storybook stories to showcase Next button functionality
- [ ] T029 [P] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] T030 [P] Create documentation for new runtime components
- [ ] T031 Run full regression test suite to ensure no breaking changes
- [ ] T032 Validate quickstart.md implementation steps
- [ ] T033 Final integration testing with real workout scripts

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies (MUST respect these)
- **Tests before implementation**: T004-T011 MUST be completed and FAILING before T012-T021
- **Core components before integration**: T012-T014 must complete before T015-T021
- **Integration before validation**: T015-T021 must complete before T022-T026

### Parallel Execution Groups
**Group 1 (Tests - can run in parallel)**:
```
Task: "Contract test NextEvent creation and properties in tests/runtime/NextEvent.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test NextEventHandler event processing in tests/runtime/NextEventHandler.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test NextAction execution in tests/runtime/NextAction.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test Next button functionality in tests/integration/NextButton.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test rapid click handling in tests/integration/NextButton.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test script completion boundary in tests/integration/NextButton.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test error handling scenarios in tests/integration/NextButton.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test JitCompilerDemo Next button handler in tests/stories/JitCompilerDemo.test.tsx"
```

**Group 2 (Core Components - can run in parallel)**:
```
Task: "Create NextEvent class in src/runtime/NextEvent.ts"
Task: "Create NextEventHandler class in src/runtime/NextEventHandler.ts"
Task: "Create NextAction class in src/runtime/NextAction.ts"
```

**Group 3 (Polish tasks - can run in parallel)**:
```
Task: "Add comprehensive error logging and debugging information"
Task: "Update Storybook stories to showcase Next button functionality"
Task: "Add performance monitoring and metrics"
Task: "Create documentation for new runtime components"
```

### Sequential Dependencies
- T015 (JitCompilerDemo update) blocks T016-T018 (same file)
- T019-T021 (Handler registration) may have dependencies based on specific block implementations
- T022-T026 must complete before T030-T033 (validation before polish)

## Task Details

### High-Impact Tasks
- **T007**: Core integration test - validates end-to-end Next button functionality
- **T015**: Critical UI integration - enables actual Next button functionality
- **T022**: User acceptance validation - ensures feature works in Storybook
- **T032**: Quickstart validation - confirms implementation matches documented steps

### Risk Mitigation Tasks
- **T026**: Performance validation - ensures <50ms event processing target met
- **T025**: Memory integrity test - prevents memory leaks during repeated operations
- **T031**: Regression testing - ensures no breaking changes to existing functionality

### Quality Assurance Tasks
- **T027**: Error logging - essential for debugging and maintenance
- **T028**: Storybook updates - ensures proper component documentation
- **T030**: Documentation - maintains code quality and developer experience

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
