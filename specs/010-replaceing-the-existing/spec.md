# Feature Specification: Clock & Memory Visualization Stories

**Feature Branch**: `010-replaceing-the-existing`  
**Created**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "replaceing the existing clock face stories with something that like the runtime classes allows you to visualise the memory allocations that the timers are working on   the existing clock stories will first need to be deleted, and new stories based on sections of memory being shared witht he clock face to be displayed as well as the visual represenations of the runtime memory."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need to see and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific React components, no code structure)
- üë• Written for product/UX stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer debugging timer behavior in workouts, I need to see both the clock display (what the user sees) and the underlying timer memory allocations (what's happening internally) in a single view, so I can understand how memory state drives the clock visualization.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Storybook environment with timer-based workout scenarios, **When** a developer navigates to the Clock & Memory Visualization stories section, **Then** they see stories that show both the clock face display and the associated timer memory allocations simultaneously

2. **Given** a story displaying a running timer, **When** the developer views the page, **Then** they can see:
   - The clock face showing elapsed time (as users would see it)
   - Timer memory allocations (time spans array, running state boolean)
   - Visual connection between the memory data and the clock display

3. **Given** a story with a paused timer, **When** the developer inspects the memory section, **Then** they can see:
   - Multiple time span entries showing start/stop timestamps
   - Running state set to false
   - Clock face displaying the total elapsed time from all spans

4. **Given** multiple timer scenarios (completed, running, paused, zero duration), **When** the developer browses different stories, **Then** each story clearly demonstrates how different memory states produce different clock visualizations

5. **Given** the existing Runtime Stack & Memory Visualization pattern, **When** the new clock stories are created, **Then** they follow the same visual design, hover interactions, and layout patterns as the runtime visualization stories

### Edge Cases
- What happens when timer has zero elapsed time? (Both clock and memory should show appropriate empty/zero state)
- How does system display very long durations (days/hours)? (Memory shows raw timestamps, clock shows formatted units)
- What if timer memory references don't exist? (Show error state or placeholder with explanation)
- How are multiple concurrent timers displayed? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Does feature support multiple timers in one view, or one timer per story?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Story Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all existing standalone clock stories from the `stories/clock/` directory that don't include memory visualization
- **FR-002**: System MUST create new story files that combine clock display with timer memory visualization
- **FR-003**: Stories MUST be organized under a clear category (e.g., "Clock & Memory Visualization" or similar) to distinguish from other story types

#### Visualization Content
- **FR-004**: Each story MUST display a clock face component showing the user-facing time representation (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.)
- **FR-005**: Each story MUST display timer memory allocations including:
  - Time spans array (array of start/stop timestamp pairs)
  - Running state (boolean indicating if timer is currently running)
  - Block key or owner identifier
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual indication of which memory allocations belong to the displayed timer
- **FR-007**: Stories MUST cover key timer scenarios:
  - Completed timer (stopped, with total elapsed time)
  - Running timer (actively counting)
  - Paused timer (stopped with multiple time spans)
  - Zero duration timer (no elapsed time)
  - Long duration timer (days/hours/minutes/seconds)

#### Visual Design & Interaction
- **FR-008**: Memory visualization MUST follow the same visual design patterns as the existing Runtime Stack & Memory Visualization stories
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify interaction model - hover highlighting, click details, no interaction, or other?]
- **FR-010**: Layout MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: side-by-side panels (like Runtime stories), vertically stacked, tabbed view, or integrated overlay?]

#### Memory Scope
- **FR-011**: Memory visualization MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: show only timer-specific memory allocations, or all memory allocations from the runtime block including metrics and other data?]
- **FR-012**: If multiple memory types are shown, system MUST provide visual distinction between timer memory and other memory types

#### Documentation & Developer Experience
- **FR-013**: Each story MUST include a description explaining what timer state is being demonstrated
- **FR-014**: Stories MUST explain the relationship between the memory values shown and the clock display output
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear examples for developers to understand how timer memory drives clock behavior

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Timer Memory Visualization**: Represents the runtime memory allocations specific to timer behavior
  - Attributes: time spans array, running state boolean, owner block key, memory reference IDs
  - Purpose: Show internal state that determines clock display
  - Relationships: Associated with one Timer/Clock display component

- **Clock Display Component**: Represents the user-facing time visualization
  - Attributes: formatted time value, time units (days/hours/minutes/seconds), labels
  - Purpose: Show what the end user sees during workout execution
  - Relationships: Driven by Timer Memory state

- **Integrated Story Instance**: Represents a single Storybook story combining clock and memory
  - Attributes: scenario name, timer state configuration, description text
  - Purpose: Demonstrate a specific timer behavior pattern
  - Relationships: Contains one Clock Display and one Timer Memory Visualization

## Next Steps

### Before Planning Phase
The following questions must be answered to proceed with implementation planning:

1. **Interaction Model** (FR-009): What interactions should the memory visualization support?
   - Option A: Hover highlighting (like Runtime stories - hover timer memory highlights clock, hover clock highlights memory)
   - Option B: Click for details (click memory entry to show detailed view)
   - Option C: Static display (no interaction, just visual layout)
   - Option D: Other interaction pattern

2. **Layout Arrangement** (FR-010): How should clock and memory be positioned?
   - Option A: Side-by-side panels (left: clock, right: memory) - matches Runtime pattern
   - Option B: Vertically stacked (top: clock, bottom: memory)
   - Option C: Tabbed view (switch between clock and memory tabs)
   - Option D: Integrated overlay (memory details shown on/near clock)

3. **Memory Scope** (FR-011): What memory should be visualized?
   - Option A: Timer-specific only (time spans, running state)
   - Option B: All timer block memory (including metrics, handlers, etc.)
   - Option C: Entire runtime memory with timer memory highlighted
   - Option D: Configurable per story

### Recommended Decision
Based on existing Runtime visualization pattern and developer debugging needs:
- **Interaction**: Option A (hover highlighting) - proven pattern
- **Layout**: Option A (side-by-side) - consistent with Runtime stories
- **Scope**: Option A (timer-specific) - focused on timer debugging, less noise

## Assumptions

1. The TimerTestHarness utility (recently created for clock stories) will be reused/adapted for these integrated stories
2. Clock components (ClockAnchor, TimeDisplay, etc.) remain functional and don't need modification
3. Runtime Stack & Memory Visualization pattern is approved and stable for reuse
4. Memory visualization components from Runtime stories can be reused or adapted
5. Stories will be in Storybook (no other documentation platform)
6. Target audience is internal developers, not external users or customers

## Success Metrics

- All existing standalone clock stories removed from codebase
- Minimum 5 new integrated clock+memory stories created covering key scenarios
- New stories follow Runtime visualization visual patterns (confirmed by visual review)
- Developer feedback indicates improved understanding of timer memory behavior
- No regression in clock component functionality
- Stories are discoverable in Storybook navigation
