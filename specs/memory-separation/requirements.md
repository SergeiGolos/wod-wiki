# Memory Separation for Runtime Debugging - Requirements

## Product Requirements Document

### 1. Introduction and Goals

The goal of this project is to enhance the debugging and analysis capabilities of the WOD Wiki runtime environment. The current structure uses a single stack for both program execution and metadata, making it difficult to debug and analyze the application's state independently. This project proposes a new memory concept to separate the two functions, allowing for independent viewing of the application's state and easier debugging of different runtime environments.

### 2. Problem Statement

Currently, the runtime structure uses a single stack that manages both program execution and all associated metadata, including state. This single-stack approach creates a major challenge for debugging, as the program's execution and its metadata are tightly coupled. Debugging different runtime environments is difficult under this structure.

### 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution introduces a separate memory concept that can be referenced and passed to other processes. This new memory is distinct from the existing execution stack.

**Key Features:**

- **Memory Allocation and Cleanup**: When new items are placed on the stack, they can allocate things to this new, separate memory. Once those items are no longer needed, they should be automatically cleaned up and removed from the memory location.

- **Independent State View**: This separation enables a debugging feature that allows users to view the state of the memory independently of the application's execution.

- **Child Execution State**: The new memory allows a "child" process to be aware of its own execution state.
