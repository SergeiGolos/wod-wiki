## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: How should athletes indicate rep completion during exercise execution? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - tap to increment OR bulk entry at any time
- Q: What happens when an athlete needs to restart or abandon a workout mid-execution? ‚Üí A: Both B and C - pause/resume OR abandon without saving
- Q: What is the required timer precision and tick rate for workout execution? ‚Üí A: Timer events use sub-second precision internally; display shows 0.1s resolution; completion records exact timestamp from trigger event
- Q: How should the system handle partial round completion in AMRAP workouts when time expires? ‚Üí A: End child blocks and record timer value; metrics calculated separately afterward
- Q: Should workout state (timer, rounds, reps) persist across browser sessions or app restarts? ‚Üí A: No persistence - state lost on close/refresh

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a CrossFit athlete, I want to execute different types of workouts (AMRAP, For Time, and variable rep schemes) with proper timing and round tracking, so that I can complete workouts according to their prescribed format and track my performance accurately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a "For Time" workout like Fran (21-15-9 of Thrusters and Pullups), **When** the athlete starts the workout, **Then** the system counts up from zero and tracks rounds and reps correctly through all three rounds.

2. **Given** an AMRAP workout like Cindy (20-minute AMRAP of 5 Pullups, 10 Pushups, 15 Squats), **When** the athlete starts the workout, **Then** the system counts down from 20 minutes while allowing continuous round progression until time expires.

3. **Given** a workout with variable reps (21-15-9), **When** the athlete completes round 1, **Then** the system automatically adjusts the target reps for round 2 from 21 to 15.

4. **Given** an athlete is in the middle of a round, **When** they complete all prescribed reps for an exercise, **Then** the system advances to the next exercise in the round.

5. **Given** a timed workout is running, **When** the timer completes (countdown reaches zero or athlete finishes all work), **Then** the system records the final time as the workout result.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an athlete pauses mid-workout? Timer should pause and resume correctly. State maintained in memory during same session.
- What happens when an athlete closes browser or refreshes during a workout? All workout state is lost - no persistence across sessions.
- What happens when an athlete abandons a workout? System discards all progress without recording any results.
- How does the system handle completing a "For Time" workout faster than expected? Timer stops immediately upon completion.
- What happens when time expires in an AMRAP before completing a round? System ends child block execution and records timer value. Metrics and scoring are calculated separately from recorded state.
- How does the system track progress within a single exercise (e.g., 21 reps)? Athletes can either tap a button to increment by 1 rep (interactive during workout) OR enter bulk rep count at any time and mark complete.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Timer Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST support countdown timers that start from a specified duration and count down to zero

- **FR-003a**: System MUST display timer values with 0.1 second (100ms) resolution to users
- **FR-003b**: System MUST record exact timestamp (full precision) at completion or button click events for accurate final time
- **FR-004**: System MUST signal completion when a countdown timer reaches zero
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow pausing and resuming timers during workout execution
- **FR-005a**: System MUST maintain workout state in memory when paused to allow resumption within same session (timer, round, exercise, reps)
- **FR-005b**: System MUST provide abandon capability that discards workout without recording any results
- **FR-005c**: System MUST NOT persist workout state across browser close/refresh or application restarts

**Round Management**
- **FR-006**: System MUST track the current round number and total rounds for round-based workouts
- **FR-007**: System MUST support variable rep schemes (e.g., 21-15-9) where rep targets change between rounds
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide the correct rep target for each exercise based on the current round
- **FR-009**: System MUST advance to the next round automatically when all exercises in the current round are completed
- **FR-010**: System MUST signal completion when all prescribed rounds are finished

**Exercise/Effort Execution**
- **FR-011**: System MUST track individual exercises (efforts) within a workout with their prescribed rep targets
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow athletes to mark exercises as complete when target reps are achieved
- **FR-012a**: System MUST support incremental rep counting via single button press (increment by 1)
- **FR-012b**: System MUST support bulk rep entry where athlete can input completed count directly
- **FR-012c**: System MUST allow switching between incremental and bulk entry modes at any time during an exercise
- **FR-013**: System MUST advance to the next exercise automatically when the current exercise is completed
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain rep targets that can be dynamically set by parent round contexts

**Workout Completion**
- **FR-015**: System MUST determine when a "For Time" workout is complete (all work finished) and stop the timer
- **FR-016**: System MUST determine when an AMRAP workout is complete (time expired) and end child block execution
- **FR-016a**: System MUST record timer value at moment of AMRAP completion (time expiry or early termination)
- **FR-017**: System MUST capture workout state at completion (timer value, current block, exercise, rep progress)
- **FR-017a**: Metric calculation and scoring occur separately from workout execution using captured state

**Workout Types**
- **FR-018**: System MUST support "For Time" workouts where the goal is to complete prescribed work as quickly as possible
- **FR-019**: System MUST support "AMRAP" (As Many Rounds As Possible) workouts with countdown timers
- **FR-020**: System MUST support workouts with fixed rounds (e.g., "3 rounds of X, Y, Z")
- **FR-021**: System MUST support workouts combining multiple characteristics (e.g., "21-15-9 For Time")
