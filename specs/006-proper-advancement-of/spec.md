## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When the system cannot determine advancement behavior (e.g., malformed script structure, circular references), what feedback mechanism should be used? ‚Üí A: Combined logging + exceptions
- Q: When a parent element contains multiple children, should they execute sequentially or in parallel? ‚Üí A: Strictly sequential - one child completes fully before next child starts
- Q: When should script structure validation occur to prevent advancement errors? ‚Üí A: Parse time - validate immediately when script is parsed, before any execution
- Q: When a runtime block is popped from the stack, what resources need cleanup? ‚Üí A: Memory references - clear object references to allow garbage collection
- Q: When a push or pop operation fails (e.g., stack overflow, corruption), should the system halt, reset, skip, or throw? ‚Üí A: Halt execution - stop all script execution immediately
- Note: Timers are handled by event handlers in memory and configured to trigger next or pop events on the runtime block that registered the duration-based event

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a workout script developer, I need the JIT compiler to properly advance through script items and create runtime blocks at the correct moments so that parent-child block relationships are maintained and the execution stack operates according to the intended workout structure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a script with nested elements (parent containing child elements), **When** the JIT compiler processes the script, **Then** runtime blocks for child elements must be created and pushed to the stack only when the parent element advances to its "next" state
2. **Given** a script with sequential elements, **When** an element completes and pops from the stack, **Then** the next element's runtime block must be created and pushed automatically
3. **Given** a script with complex nesting (grandparent-parent-child relationships), **When** processing occurs, **Then** the advancement must follow proper hierarchical order maintaining stack integrity
4. **Given** a parent element with multiple children, **When** the parent calls next(), **Then** the first child's runtime block must be created and pushed; subsequent children only start after previous child completes and pops
5. **Given** a runtime block completes execution, **When** it is popped from the stack, **Then** the system must determine if there is a next sibling block to push or if control returns to parent

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a script element has no children but expects advancement?
- How does system handle script interruption during block creation?
- What occurs when parent element completes before all children are processed?
- How are malformed script structures handled during advancement?
- What happens when stack operations fail during block creation? System halts all execution immediately.
- How does system handle circular references or infinite loops in script structure?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain proper order of script item advancement based on parent-child relationships
- **FR-002**: JIT compiler MUST create runtime blocks for child elements only when parent element advances to next state
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle push operations for new runtime blocks when advancing from parent elements
- **FR-004**: System MUST manage pop operations when elements complete execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve stack integrity during complex nested script execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST support sequential advancement for non-nested script elements
- **FR-007**: System MUST halt execution immediately when push or pop operations fail (e.g., stack overflow, corruption)
- **FR-008**: System MUST clear memory references (object references to allow garbage collection) when runtime blocks are popped from stack
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate script structure at parse time (before any execution) to prevent advancement errors
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear feedback when advancement behavior cannot be determined through both logging (for developer debugging) and runtime exceptions (to halt execution)
- **FR-011**: System MUST distinguish between "next sibling" and "next child" advancement operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST track parent context when pushing child blocks to enable proper return on pop
- **FR-013**: System MUST support lazy creation of runtime blocks (just-in-time) rather than creating all blocks upfront

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Script Item**: Represents a single element in workout script (timer, exercise, rest period, etc.) with potential parent-child relationships
- **Runtime Block**: Executable representation of a script item that can be pushed to execution stack, maintains reference to its source script item
- **Execution Stack**: Stack-based environment managing active runtime blocks, supports push/pop operations
- **Parent Element**: Script item that contains child elements requiring strictly sequential execution (one child completes fully before next begins)
- **Child Element**: Script item nested within a parent element that executes based on parent state advancement
- **Advancement State**: Current position in script execution determining next actions (next child, next sibling, or pop to parent)
