# Feature Specification: Runtime Test Bench UI

**Feature Name**: Runtime Test Bench - Integrated UI Component  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Branch**: main

---

## Overview

Create a production-ready Runtime Test Bench UI component that combines the clean visual design from the prototype (code.html) with the proven functionality of the existing JitCompilerDemo, providing developers with a professional tool for debugging and testing WOD Wiki workout runtime execution.

## Problem Statement

The current JitCompilerDemo (stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx) is a 900+ line monolithic component that serves as a proof-of-concept for runtime testing. While functional, it lacks:
- Clear visual hierarchy and professional styling
- Modular component architecture for maintainability
- Consistent design system integration
- User-friendly navigation and controls
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessibility features

The prototype (code.html) demonstrates an excellent visual design but lacks the integration with the actual runtime system.

## User Stories

### US-1: Developer Workflow
**As a** WOD Wiki developer  
**I want to** edit workout scripts and step through runtime execution with clear visualization  
**So that** I can debug workout logic, verify behavior, and understand runtime state

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can edit workout scripts in Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
- Can step through execution block-by-block
- Can see current runtime stack with visual hierarchy
- Can inspect memory state at each step
- Can reset execution and start over

### US-2: Visual Debugging
**As a** developer debugging runtime issues  
**I want to** see cross-panel highlighting between code, stack, and memory  
**So that** I can quickly trace relationships and understand execution flow

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Hovering over a block in stack highlights corresponding code line
- Hovering over a block highlights its memory entries
- Active execution block is clearly indicated with color/icon
- Parent-child relationships in stack are visually clear

### US-3: Professional UI
**As a** developer using the test bench daily  
**I want to** work in a clean, well-organized interface that fits on my screen  
**So that** I can focus on debugging without UI friction

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All panels fit on a single screen without scrolling (at 1920x1080)
- Dark theme optimized for long coding sessions
- Consistent spacing and typography throughout
- Clear visual hierarchy with color coding
- Professional appearance matching WOD Wiki design system

- Must support existing workout syntax
- Must work with current runtime blocks and behaviors

### TC-2: Framework Constraints
- React functional components only
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Storybook for component development

### TC-3: No Breaking Changes
- Cannot modify ScriptRuntime, IRuntimeBlock, or core runtime interfaces
- Must use adapter pattern to convert runtime data to UI state
- Existing JitCompilerDemo must remain functional during migration

## Success Criteria

### SC-1: Feature Complete
- All 6 panels implemented and functional
- All user stories satisfied
- All functional requirements met

### SC-2: Quality Metrics
- 90%+ unit test coverage
- Zero TypeScript strict mode errors in new code
- All accessibility audits pass
- Performance benchmarks met

### SC-3: Documentation
- Component API documentation complete
- Integration guide for developers
- Storybook stories for all panels
- Migration guide from JitCompilerDemo

### SC-4: User Acceptance
- 3+ developers test and provide feedback
- No critical usability issues identified
- Positive feedback on visual design and workflow

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- ScriptRuntime (src/runtime/ScriptRuntime.ts)
- JitCompiler (src/runtime/JitCompiler.ts)
- MdTimerRuntime parser (src/parser/)
- WodWiki editor component (src/editor/)
- RuntimeBlock implementations (src/runtime/blocks/)
- Exercise indexing system (public/exercise-*.json)

### External Dependencies
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Monaco Editor
- Storybook 9+

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** included in this feature:
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Workout execution timers (display only, not execution)
- Saving workouts to database/backend
- User authentication or profiles
- Mobile app version
- Export to video/animated GIF
- AI-powered workout suggestions
- Performance profiling beyond basic metrics

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Integrating with existing runtime system may reveal unexpected issues  
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**: Use adapter pattern to isolate integration points; comprehensive integration testing

### Risk 2: Performance with Large Scripts
**Risk**: Memory panel may lag with 100+ entries  
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Implement virtualization for large lists; lazy loading of expanded values

### Risk 3: Cross-Panel State Sync
**Risk**: Keeping 4+ panels synchronized may introduce subtle bugs  
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Single source of truth with hooks; comprehensive state management tests

## Clarifications

### Session 1: October 16, 2025

**Q1: What is the exact layout grid specification?**  
**A**: Use Tailwind CSS `grid-cols-10 grid-rows-2` with 4-panel layout:
- Top-left (Editor): col-span-4 (40% width)
- Top-right (Compilation): col-span-6 (60% width)
- Bottom-left (Stack): col-span-4 (40% width)
- Bottom-right (Memory): col-span-6 (60% width)
- Gap: 16px (gap-4)
- Container padding: 16px (p-4)

**Q2: What are the exact colors to use?**  
**A**: From prototype code.html:
```
Primary: #FFA500 (Orange)
Background Dark: #282c34
Panel Background: #3c4049
Text Color: #abb2bf
Success: #98c379 (Green)
Error: #e06c75 (Red)
Info: #61afef (Blue)
```

**Q3: Which components should be extracted from JitCompilerDemo vs built new?**  
**A**: 
- **Extract & Enhance**: ScriptEditor, CompactRuntimeStackVisualizer, MemoryVisualizationTable
- **Build New**: Toolbar, CompilationPanel, ControlsPanel, StatusFooter
- **Wrapper**: RuntimeTestBench (main component)

**Q4: How should the RuntimeAdapter pattern work?**  
**A**: 
- Adapter converts ScriptRuntime state to ExecutionSnapshot
- ExecutionSnapshot contains: stack blocks, memory entries, status, metadata
- Adapter isolates runtime system from UI concerns
- No modifications to ScriptRuntime or IRuntimeBlock interfaces

**Q5: What keyboard shortcuts are required?**  
**A**:
- `Space`: Next Block
- `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`: Run
- `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R`: Reset
- `Ctrl+/` / `Cmd+/`: Toggle comments
- `F5`: Run
- `F10`: Step Over
- `F11`: Step Into
- `Shift+F5`: Reset
- `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F`: Search in memory

**Q6: What test scenarios must be supported?**  
**A**:
1. Simple AMRAP workout (warmup, main, cooldown)
2. Nested rounds with timers
3. EMOM with multiple exercises
4. Complex workout with 100+ memory entries
5. Syntax error scenarios
6. Empty script edge case

**Q7: What is the migration strategy from JitCompilerDemo?**  
**A**:
- Phase 1: Create new component alongside existing
- Phase 2: Move Storybook stories to new component
- Phase 3: Deprecate JitCompilerDemo with migration notice
- Phase 4: Remove after 1-2 release cycles
- No forced migration; allow gradual adoption

**Q8: What browser features can we rely on?**  
**A**:
- CSS Grid (universally supported)
- CSS Custom Properties (for theming)
- ES2020 features (Chrome 90+)
- No IE11 support required
- Assume modern evergreen browsers
