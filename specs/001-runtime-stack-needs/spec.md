# Feature Specification: Runtime Stack Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-runtime-stack-needs`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Runtime Stack needs to be defined correctly to support push(IRuntimeBlock) push an item on the stack (run the push() block before the block is on the stack to do proper initialization with the current stack values), pop() : IRuntimeBlock pop the top most item from the stack run the pop command after, current(): IRuntimeBlock top most element on the stack, graph() IRuntimeBlock[] with the top most element of the stack in position 0 and each item in the stack following next."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Runtime stack operations enhancement
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Runtime execution engine, Workout script blocks
   ‚Üí Actions: Push blocks with initialization, Pop blocks with cleanup, Access current block, Get stack graph
   ‚Üí Data: Stack of IRuntimeBlock objects
   ‚Üí Constraints: Initialization must happen before stack push, cleanup after stack pop
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific initialization needs to happen in push() before adding to stack?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific cleanup operations need to happen in pop() after removal?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for runtime block management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí IRuntimeBlock, RuntimeStack
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding initialization and cleanup details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a workout runtime execution engine, I need to manage a stack of runtime blocks that properly initialize when pushed and cleanup when popped, so that workout scripts can execute with correct state management and proper resource handling throughout nested block execution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty runtime stack, **When** a runtime block is pushed with initialization requirements, **Then** the block's initialization logic executes before the block is added to the stack and becomes the current block
2. **Given** a runtime stack with multiple blocks, **When** the top block is popped, **Then** the block is removed from the stack, its cleanup logic executes afterward, and the previous block becomes current
3. **Given** a runtime stack with blocks, **When** requesting the current block, **Then** the topmost block on the stack is returned
4. **Given** a runtime stack with multiple blocks, **When** requesting the stack graph, **Then** an ordered list is returned with the topmost element at position 0 and subsequent elements following in stack order

### Edge Cases
- What happens when popping from an empty stack?
- How does the system handle initialization failures during push operations?
- What occurs if cleanup operations fail during pop?
- How does the current() method behave with an empty stack?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute block initialization logic before adding a block to the runtime stack
- **FR-002**: System MUST add the initialized block to the top of the runtime stack after successful initialization
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove the topmost block from the runtime stack when pop() is called
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute block cleanup logic after removing a block from the stack
- **FR-005**: System MUST return the removed block after cleanup operations complete
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide access to the current (topmost) block on the stack
- **FR-007**: System MUST return undefined when accessing current block on an empty stack
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a graph view of the stack with topmost element at index 0
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain proper stack ordering in the graph representation
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: initialization failure scenarios - should push be aborted?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cleanup failure scenarios - should pop continue or rollback?]

### Key Entities
- **RuntimeStack**: Manages the ordered collection of runtime blocks with proper lifecycle management
- **IRuntimeBlock**: Individual executable block that requires initialization before use and cleanup after removal
