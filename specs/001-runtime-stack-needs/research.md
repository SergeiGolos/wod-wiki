# Research: Runtime Stack Enhancement

## Overview
Research findings for enhancing RuntimeStack with proper lifecycle management, initialization, and cleanup operations while maintaining interface compatibility.

## Initialization Patterns Research

### Decision: Constructor-Based Initialization
**Rationale**: Initialization happens during IRuntimeBlock construction, not during push operations. This simplifies the stack operations and makes initialization timing explicit and predictable.

**Implementation Approach**:
- IRuntimeBlock constructors handle their own initialization
- No initialization calls needed in RuntimeStack.push()
- Stack operations become simpler and more focused
- Initialization context must be provided at construction time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pre-push initialization hooks: Rejected due to updated requirements
- Post-push initialization: Rejected because timing should be at construction
- Event-based initialization: Rejected for complexity and determinism concerns

## Cleanup Patterns Research

### Decision: Consumer-Managed Dispose Pattern
**Rationale**: Cleanup is now handled via a `dispose()` method that consumers must call after popping blocks from the stack. This follows standard resource management patterns and makes cleanup responsibility explicit.

**Implementation Approach**:
- IRuntimeBlock has required `dispose()` method
- RuntimeStack.pop() returns block without calling dispose
- Consumer code must call `block.dispose()` after pop
- Clear separation of concerns: stack manages ordering, consumer manages lifecycle

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Automatic cleanup in pop: Rejected due to updated requirements favoring explicit consumer control
- Destructor-based cleanup: Rejected because JavaScript doesn't have deterministic destructors
- External cleanup manager: Rejected for added complexity over explicit consumer calls

## Error Handling Research

### Decision: Simplified Error Handling
**Rationale**: With constructor-based initialization and consumer-managed disposal, stack operations have minimal error scenarios.

**Stack Operation Errors**:
- Empty pop: Return undefined (standard pattern)
- Invalid push: Standard TypeError for null/undefined blocks
- No lifecycle method error handling needed in stack operations

**Consumer Responsibility**:
- Constructor failures: Handle at block creation time
- Dispose failures: Consumer must handle dispose() exceptions
- Clear error boundaries between stack operations and lifecycle management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Complex error recovery in stack: Rejected because lifecycle is now external
- Retry mechanisms: Rejected for deterministic execution requirements
- Exception wrapping: Rejected to keep stack operations simple

## Interface Design Research

### Decision: Breaking Changes for Clarity
**Rationale**: No backward compatibility required allows for cleaner, more explicit interface design.

**RuntimeStack Methods**:
- `push(block: IRuntimeBlock): void` - simplified implementation, no lifecycle calls
- `pop(): IRuntimeBlock | undefined` - simplified implementation, no lifecycle calls
- `current` getter - unchanged behavior
- `graph(): IRuntimeBlock[]` - new method as specified
- Remove unnecessary complexity from lifecycle management

**IRuntimeBlock Interface**:
- Add required `dispose(): void` method - must be implemented by all blocks
- Constructor handles initialization - no special initialize method needed
- Clear separation: stack manages ordering, blocks manage their own lifecycle

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Minimal Overhead Pattern
**Rationale**: Stack operations are frequent during workout execution and must remain fast.

**Optimizations**:
- Use `typeof block.initialize === 'function'` checks (fast)
- No additional data structures or state tracking
- Preserve existing array-based implementation
- Optional method calls add <1ms overhead per operation

**Benchmarking Plan**:
- Unit tests to verify <50ms total operation time
- Performance regression tests in existing test suite

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Comprehensive TDD Approach
**Rationale**: Runtime stack is critical infrastructure requiring extensive test coverage.

**Test Categories**:
1. **Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
   - Stack operations with/without lifecycle methods
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Edge cases (empty stack, etc.)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - RuntimeStack with actual IRuntimeBlock implementations
   - Lifecycle method interactions with runtime execution
   - Stack graph ordering validation

3. **Storybook Interaction Tests**:
   - Visual validation of stack state in runtime components
   - User scenario walkthroughs

**Mock Strategy**:
- Create test IRuntimeBlock implementations with lifecycle methods
- Use Vitest spies to verify method call sequences
- Test both with and without optional methods

## Dependencies Analysis

### Current Dependencies
- **IRuntimeBlock interface**: Needs extension for optional lifecycle methods
- **Console logging**: Existing pattern preserved
- **Array operations**: Current implementation maintained

### New Dependencies
- None - enhancement uses existing TypeScript/JavaScript features
- Optional chaining (`?.`) for safe method calls
- Type guards for method existence checks

## Migration Strategy

### Decision: Zero-Breaking-Change Approach
**Rationale**: Existing RuntimeStack usage throughout codebase must continue working.

**Migration Steps**:
1. Extend IRuntimeBlock interface with optional methods
2. Update RuntimeStack implementation with lifecycle calls
3. Update tests to cover new functionality
4. Add Storybook examples demonstrating lifecycle behavior
5. Update documentation and examples

**Rollback Plan**:
- Changes are additive only
- Remove lifecycle method calls to revert to original behavior
- No existing code needs modification

## Graph Method Implementation

### Decision: Top-First Ordering
**Ratolution**: User specification requires "topmost element of the stack in position 0".

**Implementation**:
```typescript
public graph(): IRuntimeBlock[] {
    return this.blocks; // Already returns top-first ordering
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Reuses existing `blocks` getter implementation
- Maintains consistent ordering with existing `blocksTopFirst` getter
- Simple alias that clearly expresses intent
