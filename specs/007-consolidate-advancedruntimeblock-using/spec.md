## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a runtime system developer, I need to compose runtime blocks with different capabilities (sequential execution, lazy compilation, parent context awareness) so that I can create flexible runtime patterns without being constrained by inheritance hierarchies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a RuntimeBlock with child statements, **When** the block is advanced through its lifecycle, **Then** each child is compiled and executed sequentially without requiring AdvancedRuntimeBlock inheritance.

2. **Given** a RuntimeBlock with lazy compilation behavior, **When** next() is called, **Then** children are compiled on-demand using JIT rather than all at once during initialization.

3. **Given** a RuntimeBlock with parent context behavior, **When** the block is pushed onto the stack, **Then** it maintains awareness of its parent block for context-aware execution.

4. **Given** a RuntimeBlock with completion tracking behavior, **When** all children have been processed, **Then** the block correctly reports completion status.

5. **Given** multiple behaviors attached to a single RuntimeBlock, **When** lifecycle methods are called, **Then** all behaviors execute in deterministic order and their actions compose correctly.

6. **Given** existing code using AdvancedRuntimeBlock, **When** migrated to behavior-based composition, **Then** all functionality remains identical with no behavioral changes.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: For behavior state management across lifecycle calls, which approach should be used? → A: Behaviors use RuntimeBlock allocated memory references with get/set methods for shared state, plus internal instance variables for behavior-specific state
- Q: For JIT compilation failure handling during lazy compilation, what should the behavior do? → A: Push ErrorRuntimeBlock that stops execution with error end behavior
- Q: For the backward compatibility approach during migration, what pattern should be used? → A: Direct replacement with deprecation warnings but no compatibility layer

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a behavior needs to maintain state across multiple lifecycle calls?
  - Behaviors receive allocated memory references from RuntimeBlock with get/set methods for shared state (timers, metrics, etc.), plus internal instance variables for behavior-specific state

- How does the system handle behaviors that need to coordinate with each other?
  - Behaviors coordinate through shared memory references provided by RuntimeBlock and can access block metadata for coordination
  
- What happens when lazy compilation fails for a child statement?
  - Behavior pushes ErrorRuntimeBlock onto stack that stops execution with error end behavior
  
- How does the system handle performance degradation from multiple behaviors?
  - Performance benchmarks must validate <5ms execution time for next() with full behavior stack
  
- What happens when behaviors are added or removed during block lifecycle?
  - Behaviors are immutable after block construction; changes require new block instance

### Key Entities *(mandatory)*

- **RuntimeBlock**: Base runtime execution unit with lifecycle methods and behavior composition support. Contains behavior array and delegates lifecycle events to attached behaviors.

- **IRuntimeBehavior**: Interface defining optional lifecycle hooks (onPush, onNext, onPop, onDispose) that receive runtime and block context. Behaviors implement subset of hooks relevant to their functionality. Can access RuntimeBlock allocated memory references with get/set methods for shared state management.

- **ChildAdvancementBehavior**: Tracks sequential position within child statement array, advances one child per next() call, provides current index and children access.

- **LazyCompilationBehavior**: Compiles child statements on-demand using JIT compiler, integrates with child advancement to compile only current child, returns NextAction with compiled block.

- **ParentContextBehavior**: Maintains reference to parent runtime block, provides context awareness for nested execution scenarios.

- **CompletionTrackingBehavior**: Monitors child advancement progress, marks completion when all children processed, influences action generation at completion.

- **CodeStatement**: Array of statements provided to behaviors for lazy compilation, represents parsed workout script structure.

- **ErrorRuntimeBlock**: Special runtime block pushed onto stack when JIT compilation fails, stops execution with error end behavior.

- **IRuntimeAction**: Actions returned by behaviors during lifecycle events (NextAction, PopAction, etc.), composed across multiple behaviors.

- **IScriptRuntime**: Runtime context provided to behaviors, includes JIT compiler access and execution environment.
