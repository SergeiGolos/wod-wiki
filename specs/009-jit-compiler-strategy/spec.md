## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **workout application developer** testing the WOD Wiki runtime system, I need to **observe the JIT compiler correctly transforming parsed workout statements into specialized runtime blocks** so that I can **verify the execution engine properly advances through different workout structures** (AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, Tabata, etc.) and **validate that each block type displays its correct state in the demo interface**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a parsed workout script is loaded into the runtime demo, **When** the developer clicks the "Next Block" button, **Then** the runtime stack should display a second block with a type-specific name (not generic "Runtime (Idle)")

2. **Given** an AMRAP workout script (time-bound rounds), **When** the JIT compiler processes the root statement, **Then** a timer-based parent block should be created and pushed to the stack

3. **Given** a "For Time" workout script (bounded rounds without timer), **When** the JIT compiler processes the root statement, **Then** a rounds-based parent block should be created and pushed to the stack

4. **Given** a simple effort statement (single exercise with reps), **When** the JIT compiler processes the statement and no timer/rounds modifiers exist, **Then** an effort block should be created as the fallback block type

5. **Given** a parent block with multiple child statements, **When** the block advances to the next child, **Then** the child statement should be compiled and pushed onto the stack with appropriate behaviors for further advancement

6. **Given** multiple strategy types are registered in the compiler, **When** a statement is compiled, **Then** strategies should be evaluated in precedence order (most specific to most general) until a match is found

7. **Given** the runtime demo interface displays the current stack, **When** different block types are present, **Then** each block should display its specific type name and current state (not all showing as "Idle")

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a statement contains both timer AND rounds fragments? ‚Üí Reject as ambiguous syntax requiring user clarification
- How does the system handle malformed statements that don't match any strategy? ‚Üí Create generic error block with diagnostic information
- What happens when the stack reaches maximum depth or runs out of child statements? ‚Üí Stack has no maximum depth limit; relies on memory constraints
- How should the system behave if a strategy's compile method fails or returns null?
- What happens when behaviors cannot be propagated to child blocks?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Strategy Matching and Compilation**
- **FR-001**: System MUST evaluate registered strategies in a defined precedence order (most specific patterns before generic patterns); first matching strategy compiles the statement, subsequent strategies are not evaluated
- **FR-002**: System MUST match strategies based on the presence or absence of specific fragment types in code statements (timer fragments, rounds fragments, effort fragments)
- **FR-003**: Strategies MUST NOT match statements they are not designed to handle (e.g., effort strategy must match only when !hasTimer && !hasRounds; timer strategy must match only when hasTimer; rounds strategy must match only when hasRounds)
- **FR-004**: System MUST compile matching statements into specialized block types that reflect the workout structure
- **FR-005**: System MUST use a fallback strategy that matches any statement when no specific strategy matches

**Runtime Block Advancement**
- **FR-006**: System MUST advance the current block's child index when a "next" event is triggered
- **FR-007**: System MUST compile the next child statement using the JIT compiler when advancing
- **FR-008**: System MUST push newly compiled child blocks onto the runtime stack
- **FR-009**: Compiled child blocks MUST receive appropriate behaviors to enable further compilation if they have children
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent advancement beyond the last child statement in a block

**Block Type Differentiation**
- **FR-011**: Runtime blocks MUST be identifiable by type (timer blocks, rounds blocks, effort blocks, generic blocks)
- **FR-012**: Block type information MUST be accessible to the demo interface for display purposes
- **FR-013**: Each block type MUST display a meaningful name (not generic "Runtime" for all types)
- **FR-014**: Block type values MUST use PascalCase format matching fragment type names: "Timer" for timer strategies, "Rounds" for rounds strategies, "Effort" for effort strategies (e.g., `new RuntimeBlock(..., "Timer")` not "timer-block" or "TimerBlock")

**Fragment-Based Pattern Recognition**
- **FR-015**: System MUST correctly identify timer fragments in parsed statements
- **FR-016**: System MUST correctly identify rounds fragments in parsed statements
- **FR-017**: System MUST correctly identify effort fragments (exercise definitions) in parsed statements
- **FR-018**: Fragment identification MUST be based on fragment type properties, not runtime metrics

**Behavior Propagation**
- **FR-019**: Compiled blocks with child statements MUST receive child advancement behavior (via constructor injection: pass ChildAdvancementBehavior instance to RuntimeBlock constructor)
- **FR-020**: Compiled blocks with child statements MUST receive lazy compilation behavior (via constructor injection: pass LazyCompilationBehavior instance to RuntimeBlock constructor)
- **FR-021**: Behavior composition MUST enable recursive compilation of nested workout structures
- **FR-022**: System MUST maintain behavior state across multiple advancement operations

**Demo Interface Display**
- **FR-023**: Demo interface MUST display all blocks currently on the runtime stack
- **FR-024**: Each displayed block MUST show its type-specific name
- **FR-025**: Each displayed block MUST show its current state (idle, executing, completed, etc.)
- **FR-026**: Demo interface MUST update the stack display when blocks are pushed or popped
- **FR-027**: Demo interface MUST provide a "Next Block" button to trigger advancement events

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Strategy matching MUST complete with no specific performance targets required (demo-only validation)
- **NFR-002**: Maintainability MUST follow existing patterns: strategy pattern with interface-based contracts, constructor-based initialization for runtime blocks, behavior composition using passed instances (no inheritance), TDD with contract tests before implementation
- **NFR-003**: Block compilation MUST NOT cause memory leaks (stack has no maximum depth limit, relies on memory constraints)

### Key Entities

- **Strategy**: A pattern-matching and compilation rule that identifies specific workout structure types (timer-based, rounds-based, effort-based) and produces corresponding specialized runtime blocks
  - Evaluates code statements to determine if they match its pattern
  - Has a defined precedence in the evaluation order
  - Produces typed blocks when matched

- **Runtime Block**: An executable unit representing a portion of a workout script, containing source statement information, execution behaviors, and child management capabilities
  - Has a specific type (timer, rounds, effort, generic)
  - Contains zero or more child statements to be compiled
  - Maintains current execution state (idle, executing, completed)
  - Can advance to next child and trigger compilation

- **Fragment**: A parsed token from a workout script statement representing a specific workout element (timer duration, round count, exercise definition)
  - Has a type identifier (timer, rounds, effort, etc.)
  - Contains parsed values (durations, counts, names)
  - Used by strategies for pattern matching

- **Behavior**: A reusable execution capability attached to runtime blocks that implements specific advancement or compilation logic
  - Child Advancement Behavior: tracks position in child array, increments index
  - Lazy Compilation Behavior: retrieves current child, invokes JIT compiler, returns compiled block
  - Can be composed to create complex block capabilities

- **Runtime Stack**: An ordered collection of runtime blocks representing the current execution path through a workout script
  - Contains root block and all active child blocks
  - Grows when child blocks are compiled and pushed
  - Shrinks when blocks complete and are popped
  - Current block is at top of stack

### Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Developer can click "Next Block" in demo and observe a second block added to the stack display
- **SC-002**: AMRAP workout examples compile into timer-based parent blocks with effort children
- **SC-003**: "For Time" workout examples compile into rounds-based parent blocks with effort children
- **SC-004**: Simple effort statements compile into effort blocks when no timer/rounds modifiers present
- **SC-005**: Demo interface displays distinct block type names (not all showing "Runtime (Idle)")
- **SC-006**: Console logs show strategy matching occurring with correct precedence order
- **SC-007**: Compiled child blocks can be further advanced if they contain children
- **SC-008**: All existing workout examples in stories compile correctly with new strategy system

### Dependencies and Assumptions

**Dependencies**
- Parsed workout scripts must be available as ICodeStatement instances with populated fragments arrays
- Demo interface must be capable of displaying runtime stack state
- Event system must properly propagate Next events to current block
- Action system must correctly execute push operations on runtime stack

**Assumptions**
- Fragment type system is complete and stable
- The demo interface provides a mechanism for triggering block advancement events
- Stack visualization components exist and can display block information
- RuntimeBlock remains a single concrete class; block type differentiation uses blockType string parameter (no subclass hierarchy needed)
- Block compilation occurs on-demand through behavior composition
- Strategy evaluation order can be controlled through registration sequence
- Behavior instances can be safely reused across multiple block instances
- Demo is for development validation, not production use (no specific performance targets required)
- Runtime stack has no maximum depth limit (relies on memory constraints)
