# Feature Specification: Runtime Memory-Behavior Responsibilities

**Feature Branch**: `002-iruntimememory-and-iruntimeblock`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "IRuntimeMemory and IRuntimeBlock and IBehavior have specific responsabilities.

if an ibehvario has a memory reference it needs to work on, it should be able be required in the constructor.  this means that the IRuntimeBlock implementations that defines some behaviors must first do memory allocations for those."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections: Must be completed for every feature
- Optional sections: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. Mark all ambiguities: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. Don't guess: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. Think like a tester: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. Common underspecified areas:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a runtime architect, I can define behaviors for `IRuntimeBlock` implementations so that any behavior requiring memory access declares its memory dependency up-front (e.g., via constructor injection). When the block is built, it allocates the necessary memory using `IRuntimeMemory` and wires behaviors with those references before execution, ensuring deterministic and discoverable memory flows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a behavior that needs to read/write runtime state, **when** I construct it, **then** the required memory handles are passed in the constructor and validated (no lazy lookups at execution time).
2. **Given** an `IRuntimeBlock` implementation that composes behaviors, **when** the block is instantiated, **then** it requests memory allocations from `IRuntimeMemory` for each behavior dependency before behaviors are created.
3. **Given** a behavior declared without the needed memory dependency, **when** the block tries to build it, **then** block construction fails with a descriptive error rather than deferring to runtime.
4. **Given** a runtime execution, **when** behaviors run, **then** they operate on memory references that were provisioned during block construction (no implicit global state access).
5. **Given** diagnostic tooling or logging, **when** a block is built, **then** there is traceable information mapping which behaviors use which memory allocations so developers can debug lifecycle issues.

### Edge Cases
- Behaviors that do not need memory should be constructible without extra allocations.
- Blocks that reuse shared memory areas across behaviors must ensure allocation happens once and references are shared explicitly.
- Serialized/deserialized blocks must rehydrate memory requirements deterministically.
- Blocks built via factories or code generation must still satisfy constructor requirements.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Every behavior implementation MUST declare memory dependencies explicitly at creation time (e.g., constructor parameters).
- **FR-002**: `IRuntimeBlock` builders MUST allocate required memory through `IRuntimeMemory` before constructing behaviors that depend on it.
- **FR-003**: If a behavior declares a memory dependency that cannot be satisfied, block construction MUST surface a failure before execution.
- **FR-004**: Memory allocations triggered for behaviors MUST be tracked so diagnostics can report which behavior uses which allocation.
- **FR-005**: Blocks MUST ensure memory references passed to behaviors remain valid for the behavior‚Äôs lifecycle.
- **FR-006**: Blocks MUST differentiate between behaviors that require unique memory versus those that can share allocations; the allocation strategy MUST be configurable per behavior.
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST describe the responsibilities of `IRuntimeMemory`, `IRuntimeBlock`, and `IBehavior`, including how memory requirements are declared and fulfilled.
- **FR-008**: Existing tests or new tests MUST cover behavior construction with required memory references.
- **FR-009**: Behavior factories or dependency injection hooks MUST enforce the same memory dependency contract.
- **FR-010**: Telemetry/logging MUST capture allocation mapping for observability (aligning with constitution observability principle).
- **FR-011**: The runtime MUST remain deterministic when memory dependencies are resolved (no lazy allocations mid-execution).
- **FR-012**: Provide migration guidance for existing behaviors that currently fetch memory lazily, including examples or TODO markers.
- **FR-013**: Provide clear error messages when memory requirements are misconfigured.
- **FR-014**: Ensure constructor requirements work across TypeScript/JS build targets and Storybook runtime stories.
- **FR-015**: Update interface documentation pages to reflect the new contract.
- **FR-016**: Update quickstart/onboarding materials with guidance on declaring memory dependencies.

Clarifications needed:
- **FR-017**: Memory ownership semantics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should blocks allocate and dispose memory, or can behaviors release it?]
- **FR-018**: Threading/concurrency assumptions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are allocations per execution instance or shared?]
- **FR-019**: Backwards compatibility timeline [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should legacy behavior construction be supported?]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **IRuntimeMemory**: Component responsible for allocating and managing runtime memory handles.
- **IRuntimeBlock**: Builder/executor of behaviors; orchestrates memory provisioning for behaviors.
- **IBehavior**: Executable unit that may require memory references to operate.
- **BehaviorMemoryDescriptor**: Conceptual entity describing required memory (size, type, lifecycle).
- **BehaviorFactory**: Optional factory that ensures constructor requirements are satisfied.
