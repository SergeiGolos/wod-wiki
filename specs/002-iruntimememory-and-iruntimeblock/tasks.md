# Tasks: Runtime Memory-Behavior Responsibilities

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Audit existing behaviors for implicit memory usage
- [ ] T002 Document current memory allocation flow in docs/interfaces

## Phase 3.2: Tests First
- [ ] T003 Add failing tests for behavior constructors requiring memory references
- [ ] T004 Add failing tests for block construction failure when descriptors missing
- [ ] T005 Add failing tests to verify allocation logs/diagnostics

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation
- [ ] T006 Implement BehaviorMemoryDescriptor metadata support
- [ ] T007 Update RuntimeBlock construction pipeline to allocate descriptors before behavior instantiation
- [ ] T008 Update behaviors to accept injected memory refs
- [ ] T009 Add allocation tracking/logging

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T010 Update factories/generators to honor constructor requirements
- [ ] T011 Provide migration layer for legacy behaviors with deprecation warnings

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T012 Update docs (Overview, runtime, interfaces) with new responsibilities
- [ ] T013 Update quickstart/onboarding guidance
- [ ] T014 Ensure Storybook runtime stories demonstrate new contract
