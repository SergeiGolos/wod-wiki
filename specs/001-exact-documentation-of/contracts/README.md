# Contracts for Documentation Feature

This feature does not expose API endpoints. Contracts here define documentation deliverables and validation:

- Contract: Link Integrity
  - All referenced files exist in the repo.
- Contract: Diagram Renderability
  - Mermaid code blocks conform to GitHub-supported syntax.
- Contract: Interface Coverage
  - Each key interface has a doc page with known implementations listed.
- Contract: Language Guide Completeness
  - Core tokens and grammar rules are documented with examples.
