# Feature Specification: Exact System Documentation & Discovery

**Feature Branch**: `001-exact-documentation-of`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "exact documentation of the current system in a easy to understand structure, allowing for a jumping off point for future devoplment of this project.   A way to identify the existing sepcifications.     broken down my key parts the wod system intracts with

- parsing
- runtime / debugging
- display / UI 
- metrics collection (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections: Must be completed for every feature
- Optional sections: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. Mark all ambiguities: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. Don't guess: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. Think like a tester: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. Common underspecified areas:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a new contributor, I can open a single ‚ÄúSystem Overview‚Äù document that clearly explains how WOD Wiki works today and links into deeper, task‚Äëfocused docs for:
- Parsing (language/grammar ‚Üí internal representation)
- Runtime & Debugging (execution model, determinism, how to debug)
- Display/UI (editor, components, Storybook paths)
- Metrics Collection (types, composition, inheritance, results)

This overview is easy to navigate, uses consistent terminology, and serves as a jumping‚Äëoff point for future development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the repository root, when I open the System Overview doc, then I see a ToC and four top‚Äëlevel sections: Parsing, Runtime & Debugging, Display/UI, Metrics Collection, each with a concise overview and deep‚Äëlink references to existing docs, tests, or stories.
2. Given the System Overview doc, when I follow any internal link, then the linked file exists in the repository and the section title matches the link context.
3. Given the System Overview doc, when I look for ‚ÄúWhere are the existing specifications/tests?‚Äù, then I see a ‚ÄúSpecification Discovery‚Äù section that lists where specifications currently live (e.g., README, Storybook stories, unit tests, parser docs) with examples.
4. Given a newcomer, when they follow the onboarding path from the overview, then they can reproduce key flows: parse a sample WOD script, run a runtime example in Storybook, and locate the metrics logic.
5. Given a release change impacting language/runtime behavior, when I check the docs, then I find a ‚ÄúVersion & Changes‚Äù note indicating the affected areas and where to read migration notes or tests demonstrating the change.

### Edge Cases
- Parts of the system that are not yet fully implemented or are placeholders.
- Outdated links or renamed files/sections.
- Ambiguous terms (e.g., ‚Äúeffort‚Äù, ‚Äúresistance‚Äù) without a glossary.
- Evolving runtime architecture (JIT phases) with mocks vs concrete implementations.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The documentation MUST provide a single entrypoint ‚ÄúSystem Overview‚Äù page that orients new contributors and links to deeper topics.
- FR-002: The overview MUST include a Parsing section that explains the WodScript language at a conceptual level (tokens, grammar, visitor/AST) and points to examples and tests.
- FR-003: The overview MUST include a Runtime & Debugging section describing the execution model (deterministic time, event ordering, state), plus how to debug via Storybook or tests.
- FR-004: The overview MUST include a Display/UI section that explains the editor integration, notable UI components, and where to find Storybook stories.
- FR-005: The overview MUST include a Metrics Collection section describing metric types (effort, reps, resistance, distance), composition/inheritance, and where to find related tests.
- FR-006: The documentation MUST include a ‚ÄúSpecification Discovery‚Äù index listing where existing specifications live (e.g., README, Storybook stories, unit tests, parser docs), with at least one concrete example link per category.
- FR-007: The documentation MUST include a consistent glossary of domain terms used across Parsing, Runtime, UI, and Metrics.
- FR-008: The documentation MUST include a table of contents and navigable anchors for each major section.
- FR-009: The documentation SHOULD outline how changes map to versions (SemVer) and where to add migration notes when behavior changes.
- FR-010: The documentation MUST reflect the project‚Äôs Constitution principles relevant to docs (testability, determinism, stability of language contracts) and link to the Constitution.
- FR-011: The documentation MUST be structured so future features can add sections with minimal disruption (clear headings, short rationales, link patterns).
- FR-012: Links in the overview MUST resolve to files that exist in the repo at the time of writing; a link check MUST pass.
- FR-013: Each of the four core sections MUST include at least one ‚ÄúTry it‚Äù pointer (e.g., an example file or story to open) to validate understanding.

Examples of clarifications to obtain:
- FR-014: Docs location [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this live under docs/, wiki, README sections, or Storybook MDX pages?]
- FR-015: Doc format [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Markdown only, or include diagrams/images?]
- FR-016: Ownership [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Who maintains the docs and reviews updates?]
- FR-017: Versioning [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are docs versioned versus code releases?]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- WodScript Program: A textual workout definition parsed into an internal representation.
- Fragment: A unit of parsed meaning (e.g., action, timer, rep), used by the compiler/runtime.
- Runtime Event: A discrete event during execution (start/stop, lap, cue) with time and context.
- Metric: A quantified result (effort, reps, resistance, distance) that can be composed/inherited.
- Result Span: A span of time with associated metrics and outcomes.
- Editor View: The UI surface for authoring and visualizing programs and results.
