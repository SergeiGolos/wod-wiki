The memory card displays the current running time span with no stop timestamp, and the timer controls allow you to pause, stop, or reset the count up timer."

      description: "Count up timer that was paused and resumed, showing multiple time spans. The memory card displays both the completed 1-minute span and the current running span, demonstrating how pause/resume functionality is tracked. The clock shows cumulative elapsed time across all active periods."

The clock shows minimal time and memory tracking handles the edge case properly."
