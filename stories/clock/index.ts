/**
 * Migration Notes:
 *
 * The clock stories have been completely restructured to use a unified format:
 *
 * OLD STRUCTURE:
 * - TimerControl.stories.tsx (interactive controls only)
 * - RunningTimers.stories.tsx (running states only)
 * - CompletedTimers.stories.tsx (completed states only)
 * - EdgeCases.stories.tsx (edge cases only)
 *
 * NEW STRUCTURE:
 * - CountdownTimers.stories.tsx (all countdown scenarios)
 * - CountUpTimers.stories.tsx (all count up scenarios)
 * - UnifiedClockStory.tsx (shared wrapper component)
 * - EnhancedTimerHarness.tsx (enhanced harness with memory + controls)
 *
 * Each new story includes:
 * - Clock display
 * - Memory card with start/stop table
 * - Recalculate elapsed time button
 * - Interactive timer controls
 * - Running, stopped, and edge case examples
 *
 * The TimerControl.stories.tsx file is preserved for reference but should be
 * considered deprecated in favor of the new unified format.
