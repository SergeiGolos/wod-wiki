## Dependencies and Sequencing

**Critical Path**:
1. Exercise Index Manager (1.1) ‚Üí Exercise Data Loader (1.2) ‚Üí Exercise Search Engine (1.3) ‚Üí Basic Suggestion Provider (1.4)
2. Basic Suggestion Provider (1.4) ‚Üí Context-Aware Suggestions (2.1)
3. Search Engine (1.3) ‚Üí Advanced Search (2.2)
4. Suggestion Provider (1.4) ‚Üí Variation Selection (2.4) + Hover Documentation (2.5)

**Parallelizable Work**:
- Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 can be worked on concurrently after 1.4 completes
- Phase 3 optimization tasks (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) can be done in parallel
- Documentation (3.5) can be updated continuously throughout implementation

## Time Estimates

- Phase 1: 8-10 days (core infrastructure and basic functionality)
- Phase 2: 8-10 days (enhanced features and UX improvements)
- Phase 3: 6-8 days (optimization, testing, and polish)
- **Total**: 22-28 days (4.5-5.5 weeks)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Index loading impacts editor startup time
  - **Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading and localStorage caching (Task 3.3)

- **Risk**: Search performance degrades with large result sets
  - **Mitigation**: Result limiting and debouncing (Tasks 1.3, 3.1)

- **Risk**: Memory leaks from uncached exercise data
  - **Mitigation**: LRU cache with automatic eviction (Task 1.1)

- **Risk**: Context detection has high false positive rate
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative patterns with manual override (Task 2.1)
