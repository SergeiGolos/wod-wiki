# Exercise Typeahead Integration - OpenSpec Proposal

**Change ID**: `add-exercise-typeahead-integration`  
**Status**: Draft  
**Type**: Feature Addition

## Summary

This proposal defines the integration of the exercise path-based indexing system with Monaco Editor's typeahead functionality, enabling intelligent exercise suggestions during workout script editing.

### 4. Spec Deltas

#### [exercise-suggestions/spec.md](./specs/exercise-suggestions/spec.md)
**9 Requirements | 38 Scenarios**

- Exercise completion provider integration
- Search performance (< 100ms target)
- Metadata display (equipment, muscles, difficulty, variations)
- Intelligent ranking by relevance
- Monaco provider registration
- Asynchronous index loading
- Memory management (< 50MB increase)
- Keyboard navigation

#### [exercise-data-loading/spec.md](./specs/exercise-data-loading/spec.md)
**9 Requirements | 26 Scenarios**

- Lazy on-demand data loading
- LRU cache (100 entry limit)
- File-based access from `public/exercises/`
- Asynchronous operations
- Error handling with exponential backoff
- Singleton pattern for shared cache
- Cache invalidation
- Memory efficiency
- Promise-based API

#### [context-aware-completion/spec.md](./specs/context-aware-completion/spec.md)
**11 Requirements | 31 Scenarios**

- Context detection (exercise:, movement:, list items, reps)
- Context-based filtering (equipment, muscles, difficulty)
- Progressive disclosure for variations
- Hover documentation with exercise details
- Manual trigger (Ctrl+Space)
- Configurable patterns
- Multi-language support preparation
- State management and caching
- Context-aware ranking
- Visual feedback indicators

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Exercise Index Manager with singleton pattern
- Exercise Data Loader with LRU cache
- Exercise Search Engine with debouncing (150ms)
- Basic Suggestion Provider registration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality (Week 3-4)
- Context-Aware Suggestions with pattern matching
- Advanced Search (equipment, muscles, difficulty filters)
- Suggestion Metadata and Display enhancements
- Exercise Variation Selection interface
- Hover Documentation provider

### Phase 3: Performance and Polish (Week 5-6)
- Performance optimization (Web Workers, result pagination)
- Error handling and resilience
- Progressive loading with fallbacks
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, performance)
- Documentation and Storybook stories
- Integration and deployment

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Strategy |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Index Load (First) | < 500ms | Chunked parsing, Web Worker |
| Index Load (Cached) | < 50ms | localStorage retrieval |
| Search Query | < 100ms | Debouncing, pre-computed terms |
| Suggestion Render | < 50ms | Result limiting (max 50) |
| Exercise Data Load | < 200ms | Async fetch + cache |
| Memory Footprint | < 50MB | LRU cache, index-only storage |

## Validation Status

✅ **Validated** - All requirements pass OpenSpec validation with `--strict` flag

- All requirements include MUST/SHALL keywords
- All requirements include at least one scenario
- Proper spec delta structure (ADDED Requirements)
- Valid proposal.md, design.md, and tasks.md

## Next Steps

1. **Review Proposal**: Stakeholder review of problem statement and solution approach
2. **Validate Feasibility**: Technical validation of performance targets and architecture
3. **Approval**: Obtain approval before implementation begins
4. **Implementation**: Follow tasks.md sequentially through 3 phases
5. **Testing**: Validate all scenarios in spec deltas
6. **Deployment**: Follow deployment checklist in tasks.md
7. **Archive**: Move to archive after successful deployment

## Statistics

- **Total Requirements**: 29 (9 + 9 + 11)
- **Total Scenarios**: 95 (38 + 26 + 31)
- **Implementation Time**: 22-28 days (4.5-5.5 weeks)
- **Code Files**: ~7 new TypeScript files in `src/editor/`
- **Test Files**: ~7 corresponding test files
- **Storybook Stories**: 4 demonstration stories
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Dependencies**: 0 external (uses existing infrastructure)
