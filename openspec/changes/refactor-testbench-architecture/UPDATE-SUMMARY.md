# Update Summary: Refactor RuntimeTestBench Architecture

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All decisions incorporated and validated

---

## Changes Made Based on User Decisions

### ✅ Decision 1: RuntimeAdapter Hard Cutover
**User Answer**: "NO, remove hard cut over and clean up the code"

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated proposal.md - confirmed hard cutover approach
- ✅ Updated DECISIONS.md - documented rationale
- ✅ No changes needed to implementation (already planned for hard cutover)

---

### ✅ Decision 2: Context Granularity
**User Answer**: No answer provided (accepted recommendation)

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Accepted recommendation: Three contexts (HighlightingContext, PreferencesContext, ExecutionContext)
- ✅ Updated DECISIONS.md - documented accepted approach
- ✅ No changes needed to implementation (already planned)

---

### ✅ Decision 3: Class-Based Selectors
**User Answer**: "class based is good"

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated design.md - Changed from pure functions to RuntimeSelectors class
- ✅ Updated tasks.md - Phase 1.2 now creates RuntimeSelectors class with singleton instance
- ✅ Updated spec delta (testbench-runtime-visualization/spec.md) - All scenarios reference class methods
- ✅ Updated README.md - Examples show `runtimeSelectors.selectBlocks()` instead of `selectBlocks()`

**Implementation Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD (pure functions):
export const selectBlocks = (runtime) => { ... };

// NEW (class-based):
export class RuntimeSelectors {
  selectBlocks(runtime) { ... }
  selectMemory(runtime) { ... }
}
export const runtimeSelectors = new RuntimeSelectors();
```

---

### ✅ Decision 4: ExecutionSnapshot Removal
**User Answer**: "remove"

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated proposal.md - confirmed complete removal
- ✅ Updated DECISIONS.md - documented rationale
- ✅ No changes needed to implementation (already planned for removal)

---

### ✅ Decision 5: Fixed Tick Rate, Remove Speed Control
**User Answer**: "there is no variable updates, the ticks should happen every 20ms and have this avaliable somewher at a high level configuration, but this doesn't change, and there is no changes to execution speed to speed controller shoudl be removed."

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated design.md:
  - Changed `start(speed)` to `start()` (no parameter)
  - Added `EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS = 20` constant
  - Removed speed control benefits/discussion
  
- ✅ Updated tasks.md:
  - Phase 1.3: Added task to create constants.ts with EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS
  - Phase 1.3: Updated useRuntimeExecution to use fixed tick rate (no speed param)
  - Phase 2.3: Added tasks to **remove** speed control UI and state
  - Phase 2.4: **Removed entirely** (was "Implement Speed Control")
  - Phase 2.5: Updated validation to verify speed control removed

- ✅ Updated spec delta (testbench-execution-controls/spec.md):
  - Replaced "Execution Speed Control" requirement with "Fixed Execution Tick Rate"
  - Updated all scenarios to reference 20ms tick rate
  - Added note about elapsed time tracking (100ms) being separate from tick rate (20ms)
  - Updated migration examples to show speed props removed
  - Updated breaking changes to document speed control removal

- ✅ Updated README.md:
  - Added removal of speed control to solution list
  - Updated execution hook example to show no speed parameter
  - Updated code examples to import EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS constant

**Implementation Changes**:
```typescript
// NEW: Configuration constant
export const EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS = 20;

// OLD (variable speed):
const start = useCallback((speed: number = 100) => {
  intervalRef.current = setInterval(executeStep, speed);
}, []);

// NEW (fixed rate):
const start = useCallback(() => {
  intervalRef.current = setInterval(executeStep, EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS);
}, []);

// UI Changes:
// - Remove speed slider from ControlsPanel
// - Remove speed state from RuntimeTestBench
// - Remove onSpeedChange handler
```

## Related Changes from fix-runtime-loop-execution

For reference, the runtime execution proposal also had decisions made:

1. ✅ **LazyCompilationBehavior**: Fully remove (not kept for any block types)
2. ✅ **AMRAP Completion**: Timer creates pop events for children and existing ending timer
3. ✅ **Metric Inheritance**: JIT has knowledge of stack node, strategies access public elements
4. ✅ **Rep Scheme**: Ends when rounds complete (reps drive rounds, fewer than rounds unrealistic)
5. ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Hard cutover with test fixes (no gradual migration)

---

## Validation Results

```bash
✅ openspec validate refactor-testbench-architecture --strict
   Result: Change 'refactor-testbench-architecture' is valid
```

All changes pass strict validation with:
- ✅ All requirements have scenarios
- ✅ All breaking changes documented
- ✅ All migration paths provided
- ✅ Performance targets quantified
- ✅ Success criteria measurable

### Implementation Guide
9. ✅ `tasks.md` - Updated all phases to reflect decisions

## Summary of Key Changes

### What Changed
1. **Selectors**: Pure functions → RuntimeSelectors class with singleton
2. **Execution Tick Rate**: Variable speed (10-1000ms) → Fixed 20ms constant
3. **Speed Control UI**: Implement as feature → Remove completely
4. **Hard Cutover**: Both proposals use hard cutover (no gradual migration)

### What Stayed the Same
- ✅ Context API approach (three separate contexts)
- ✅ ExecutionSnapshot removal (complete removal)
- ✅ RuntimeAdapter removal (hard cutover)
- ✅ Module-level services pattern
- ✅ Performance targets (65-70% reduction in allocations)
- ✅ Timeline estimates (24-33 hours)

---

## Implementation Impact

### Simplified
- ❌ No speed control UI to implement
- ❌ No speed state management
- ❌ No variable interval logic
- ❌ No speed change during execution handling

### Added
- ✅ Create `config/constants.ts` with EXECUTION_TICK_RATE_MS
- ✅ RuntimeSelectors class with singleton pattern
- ✅ Class-based organization for selectors

### Net Effect
- Slightly simpler implementation (less code to write)
- More maintainable (fixed constant easier than variable speed)
- Better organized (class-based selectors)
- Clearer API (no speed parameter to document)

## Next Steps

### Ready for Implementation ✅

The proposal is now fully updated and validated. You can proceed with implementation by:

1. **Review DECISIONS.md** - Understand all finalized decisions
2. **Follow tasks.md sequentially** - Start with Phase 1
3. **Reference design.md** - For architectural details
4. **Use spec deltas** - For requirement validation

### Commands to Run
```bash
# View updated proposal
npx openspec show refactor-testbench-architecture

# Start implementation (Phase 1, Task 1.1)
# Create src/runtime-test-bench/services/testbench-services.ts

# Validate along the way
npm run test:unit
npm run storybook
```
