/**
 * Post-Mount Snapshot Invariant
 *
 * Architectural contract (from G3, hardened by S3a + S3b):
 *
 *   **Stack snapshots reflect post-mount state. A block whose `onMount` has
 *   not completed must not appear in a snapshot.**
 *
 * Concretely: when `subscribeToStack` fires for a 'push' event, the top
 * block in the snapshot must have its `onMount`-initialized memory in
 * place. If a snapshot shows a block with `getMemoryByTag('time').length
 * === 0` immediately after a push, the pre-mount leak has returned.
 *
 * The test:
 *   1. Compiles a single-block timer script (":30 Run") so the next push
 *      is a Timer whose `CountdownTimerBehavior.onMount` initializes a
 *      'time' memory location.
 *   2. Subscribes to stack snapshots and records every snapshot.
 *   3. Asserts that every snapshot whose depth includes the Timer block
 *      shows that block with non-empty time memory — i.e., `onMount`
 *      completed BEFORE the snapshot was emitted.
 *
 * If this test fails, S3a's merge of the two snapshot constructors did
 * not actually close the pre-mount leak — a regression that this invariant
 * is here to catch.
