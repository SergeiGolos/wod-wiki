/**
 * entryRun — the feed's Run action, as a real runtime start (not a link).
 *
 * WallClockPage only consumes `pendingRuntimes.get(runtimeId)`, so Run must
 * stage a pending runtime under a fresh uuidv7 key and then navigate:
 *
 *  - Playground entries keep their canonical Note UUID (results join on it)
 *    with origin 'playground' and returnTo the entry's playground deep-link.
 *  - Catalog/session/post entries follow the existing FeedItemPage adoption:
 *    the wod block is written to today's journal note and the runtime
 *    auto-starts on that journal date.
 *
 * The wod script resolves from the engine companion (entry.wodBlock), falling
 * back to resolving the note and extracting its first ```time fence. Nothing
 * navigates until persistence succeeds; failures throw for the caller's
 * visible error surface.
