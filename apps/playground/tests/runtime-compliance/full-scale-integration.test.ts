/**
 * Full-scale integration test
 *
 * Story 5's "Done when" gate. Exercises the full path:
 *
 *   1. Compile a multi-block whiteboard script (timer + rounds + rest + timer).
 *   2. Boot the runtime via TestScript — cast subscription wires automatically.
 *   3. Advance through the script via .next() (user events) and .tick() (time).
 *   4. After every step, snapshot the cast-bound messages and verify:
 *      - a `rpc-stack-update` was sent for every push/pop,
 *      - the cast's view of the stack matches the runtime's view.
 *   5. Inject a cast-side "next" event mid-script and verify the runtime
 *      advances AND the cast receives a follow-up RpcStackUpdate.
 *
 * This is the test that proves "all four stories wired together" — the
 * new builder (Story 3), the FakeRpcTransport (Story 2), the INowProvider
 * seam (Story 1), and RuntimeBlock.inspectNext (Story 4) all exercised
 * in one test run.
