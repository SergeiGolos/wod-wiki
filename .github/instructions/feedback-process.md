# Handling Feedback and Plan Updates in Markdown Documents

This document outlines the process for incorporating feedback and adjusting plans within our Markdown-based documentation. We use specific formatting conventions to track these changes.

## Feedback (`>`)

Lines prefixed with `>` represent direct feedback or questions on the preceding content. This feedback is temporary and should be addressed as follows:

1.  **Review the Feedback**: Understand the comment or question being asked.
2.  **Update the Document**: Modify the relevant section of the document to incorporate the feedback.
3.  **Remove the Feedback Line**: Once the feedback has been fully addressed, delete the line starting with `>`.

### Example

**Before:**

```markdown
The system will process requests in parallel.
> Is there a risk of race conditions with this approach?
```

**After (assuming the feedback was addressed by adding clarification):**

```markdown
The system will process requests in parallel. To prevent race conditions, we will implement a locking mechanism on shared resources.
```

## Abandoned Work (~~Strikethrough~~)

Text formatted with ~~strikethrough~~ indicates a task, feature, or plan that has been deemed out of scope or will no longer be pursued.

1.  **Identify Abandoned Work**: Recognize the text that has been struck out.
2.  **Update Related Plans**: Review any associated planning documents, task lists, or implementation plans and update them to reflect that this work is cancelled.
3.  **Remove the Strikethrough Text**: Once all related plans have been updated, remove the struck-out text from the document to keep it clean.

### Example

**Before:**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan
- Implement feature A.
- ~~Implement feature B.~~
- Implement feature C.
```

**After (assuming associated tickets/plans for Feature B have been cancelled):**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan
- Implement feature A.
- Implement feature C.
```
