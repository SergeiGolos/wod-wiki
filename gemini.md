This file provides guidance for Google Gemini when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WOD Wiki is a React component library for parsing, displaying, and executing workout definitions using a specialized syntax. It features a Monaco Editor integration, JIT compiler for workout scripts, and components styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, React, Storybook, Bun Test, Monaco Editor, Tailwind CSS, Lezer parser (CodeMirror)
**Package Manager**: bun

## Essential Development Commands

### Environment Setup
- `bun install` - Install dependencies (~15 seconds)
- `bun run setup` - Install Playwright browsers (may fail with download errors - this is expected)

### Development Workflow
- `bun run storybook` - Start Storybook development server on http://localhost:6006 (~2 seconds startup)
- `bun run build-storybook` - Build static Storybook (~30 seconds - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 60+ minutes)
- `bun run docs:check` - Validate documentation links (<1 second)

### Testing Commands
- `bun run test` - Run all unit tests (~2-3 seconds)
- `bun run test:storybook` - Run Storybook component tests (requires Playwright)
- `bun run test:watch` - Run unit tests in watch mode
- `bun run test:e2e` - Run Playwright e2e acceptance tests
- `bun x playwright test --headed` - E2E with visible browser (for debugging)

### Build & Type Checking
- `bun run build-storybook` - Build static Storybook (~30 seconds)
- `bun test src/path/to/test.test.ts --preload ./tests/unit-setup.ts` - Run single test file
- `bun x tsc --noEmit` - Type check without emitting files

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

**JIT Compiler System** (`src/runtime/compiler/JitCompiler.ts`)
- Just-In-Time compiler for workout scripts — compiles lazily, as each block is pushed onto the stack (not upfront)
- Composition pipeline: all matching `IRuntimeBlockStrategy` implementations (priority-ordered: logic → components → enhancements → fallback) apply to a shared `BlockBuilder`, rather than one strategy fully owning a block
- Coordinates metric classification, metric inheritance/promotion (e.g. rep schemes like `21-15-9` projected round-by-round into child blocks), and block creation

**Runtime Stack** (`src/runtime/RuntimeStack.ts`)
- Stack-based execution environment for workout blocks
- Constructor-based initialization pattern (blocks initialize during construction)
- Consumer-managed disposal pattern (consumer must call `dispose()` on popped blocks)
- Performance targets: push/pop < 1ms, current() < 0.1ms, dispose() < 50ms

**Parser System** (`src/parser/`, `src/grammar/`)
- Lezer-based parser (CodeMirror's LR parser) for workout syntax — not Chevrotain
- Grammar/tokens: `src/grammar/whiteboardscript.grammar` (compiled to `src/grammar/parser.ts` / `parser.terms.ts`)
- Pipeline: `md-timer.ts` (entry) → Lezer CST → `syntax-parser.ts` (CST → typed `SyntaxPrimitive`s + indentation tree) → `semantic-classifier.ts` (primitives → `IMetric`s) → dialect stack (`src/dialects/`, e.g. unit fusion) → `WhiteboardScript`
- Parses workout scripts into `ICodeStatement` nodes (`src/core/models/CodeStatement.ts`), each carrying a `MetricContainer` of typed metrics
- See `src/parser/README.md` for the two-seam design and `docs/parser-compiler-runtime-metrics.md` for the full pipeline

**Metric System** (`src/core/models/Metric.ts`, `src/runtime/compiler/metrics/`)
- There is no `src/fragments/` directory — "fragments" were replaced by typed `IMetric` objects (RepMetric, EffortMetric, DurationMetric, ResistanceMetric, DistanceMetric, RoundsMetric, etc.)
- Each metric has a `type: MetricType` and `origin: MetricOrigin` (parser/compiler/dialect/runtime/user/...), which drives ownership precedence downstream
- Metrics are the universal currency: the same `IMetric`/`MetricContainer` shapes flow from parsing through compilation, runtime memory, and the logged output statements

**Editor Integration** (`src/editor/`)
- Monaco Editor integration with custom syntax highlighting
- Suggestion engine and semantic token processing
- `WodWiki.tsx` is the main editor component

## Critical Development Patterns

### Runtime Block Lifecycle
1. **Constructor-based initialization**: Blocks initialize during construction, not when pushed to stack
2. **Consumer-managed disposal**: When popping blocks, consumer must call `dispose()`
3. **Resource cleanup**: Implement robust disposal patterns with multiple-call safety

### Parser Development
- Update tokens/grammar rules in `src/grammar/whiteboardscript.grammar` (regenerates `src/grammar/parser.ts` / `parser.terms.ts` via `lezer-generator`)
- Update CST → primitive mapping in `src/parser/syntax-parser.ts`
- Update primitive → metric classification in `src/parser/semantic-classifier.ts`
- Update unit/dialect fusion in `src/dialects/` if the change involves combining a number with a unit word
- Test with Parser stories in Storybook and `src/parser/*.test.ts`

### Component Development
- Use existing Tailwind CSS classes rather than custom CSS
- Follow TypeScript interfaces for props
- Create corresponding Storybook stories in `stories/` directory
- Export from appropriate index files if part of public API

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript & Imports
- Use strict TypeScript with interfaces for all props and return types
- Import order: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- Use `@/*` path alias for src imports (configured in tsconfig.json)
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `WorkoutTimer`)
- Functions/variables: camelCase (e.g., `parseWorkoutScript`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

### Error Handling
- Use TypeScript union types for error states
- Return `Result<T, Error>` pattern or throw descriptive errors
- Validate inputs at API boundaries

### React & Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow existing Tailwind CSS patterns, avoid custom CSS
- Create Storybook stories for all public components
- Export components from `src/index.ts` if part of public API

### Testing
- Unit tests: `src/**/*.test.ts` or `src/**/*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/**/*.test.ts`
- Story files: `stories/**/*.stories.tsx`
- Test files should be co-located with source files when possible

## Validation Requirements

After making changes, always validate:

1. **Unit Test Regression**:
   - Run `bun run test`
   - Ensure no NEW test failures are introduced
   - Accept existing 4 module failures and 1 integration test failure as baseline

2. **Type Check**:
   - Run `bun x tsc --noEmit`
   - No new type errors from your changes (369 baseline errors exist)

3. **E2E Acceptance Tests** (required for UI/layout/interaction changes):
   - Ensure Storybook is running: `bun run storybook`
   - Run `bun run test:e2e` — all e2e tests must pass
   - If you changed UI behavior, write or update an e2e test to cover the change
   - Test both mobile and desktop viewports when layout is affected
   - See `AGENTS.md` → Playwright E2E Acceptance Tests for patterns and directory structure

4. **Storybook Smoke Test**:
   - Verify Storybook loads on http://localhost:6006
   - Navigate to affected stories and confirm they render correctly

5. **Build Validation** (before merge):
   - Run `bun run build-storybook` and wait for completion (~30 seconds)
   - Verify build completes without errors and creates `storybook-static/` directory

## Known Issues and Constraints

- **Playwright Browser Download**: `bun run setup` may fail downloading Chromium browsers (expected)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 369 TypeScript errors exist in the codebase - only fix errors related to your changes
- **No ESLint**: Code style enforced through TypeScript and manual review
- **Build Times**: NEVER cancel builds - `bun run build-storybook` may take up to 60 minutes

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Always invoke tests via `bun run <script>` — never call `vitest`, `jest`, `npx`, or `npm test` directly
- Config files (`vitest.unit.config.js`, `vitest.storybook.config.js`) are internal — use the `bun run` scripts
- Place test files alongside source files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix

### Storybook Tests
- Interaction tests defined in story `play` functions
- Example: timer test in `src/stories/TimerTest.stories.tsx`
- Requires Storybook running and Playwright browsers installed

### Playwright E2E Acceptance Tests
- E2e tests are **acceptance gates** — UI/layout/interaction changes cannot be pushed without passing e2e coverage
- Tests live in `e2e/` with `*.e2e.ts` suffix; see `AGENTS.md` for full directory layout and patterns
- Reuse page objects from `e2e/pages/` and assertion helpers from `e2e/utils/`
- For layout changes, test both mobile (375×812) and desktop viewports
- Run with `bun run test:e2e`; use `--headed` for visual debugging

### Public API Exports
- Main library exports are handled through individual component exports
- Metric visualization/display components live under `src/components/metrics/` and `src/components/molecules/` (e.g. `MetricSourceRow.tsx`) — not a `src/components/fragments/` directory
- No single main index.ts file exists - exports are distributed across modules (`src/index.ts`, `src/core-entry.ts`, `src/clock-entry.ts`, `src/editor-entry.ts`)

### Documentation Files
- Save new Markdown documentation to `/docs` directory
- Documentation is managed in Obsidian and synced to the GitHub Wiki via the CMO agent
- API documentation in the Obsidian vault (`deep-dives/runtime-session-implementation.md`) provides detailed runtime stack patterns

## Performance Considerations

- All runtime stack operations must meet performance targets (see Lifecycle section)
- JIT compilation should complete within milliseconds for typical workout scripts
- Monaco Editor performance depends on efficient syntax highlighting and suggestion systems
- Memory management is critical - always dispose of runtime blocks properly

## Gemini-Specific Guidelines

### Code Generation Approach
- Focus on type-safe TypeScript implementations
- Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for complex logic
- Create modular, reusable components following the existing patterns
- Always include appropriate error handling and validation

### File Structure Adherence
- Follow the established directory structure strictly
- Use co-located test files with `.test.ts` suffix
- Create corresponding Storybook stories in the `stories/` directory
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across the project

### Integration Best Practices
- Leverage the existing JIT compiler patterns for new features
- Use the runtime stack lifecycle management correctly
- Integrate with the Monaco Editor system when working on editor features
- Follow the metric-classification patterns (typed `IMetric` subclasses with an `origin`) for new workout syntax, not a "fragment system" — that concept was replaced by metrics

### Documentation Standards
- Provide clear API documentation with examples
- Include performance considerations for runtime components
- Document any breaking changes or migration paths
- Maintain consistency with existing code documentation style
