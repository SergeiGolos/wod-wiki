## Core Workflow for AI

1. **Planning:** When requested by the user, create a plan of action.   This is when the New section at the top of the worklog should be created.
2. **Review & Refinement:** Wait for the user to review the plan. The user may edit the plan.
3. **Execution:** When instructed by the user, execute the plan.
4. **Logging:** Log the execution details and results as described below.

## Detailed Rules for AI

Here's how the AI should behave:

1. **Daily File Creation:**
    * The AI will create a new Markdown file in the `docs/Working` folder for each day's work.
    * The filename will be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2024-07-24.md`).
    * If a file for the current day already exists, the AI will append new entries to it.

2. **Planning Phase:**
    * When the user asks the AI to create a plan, the AI will add the following structure to the daily file:

        ```markdown
        ## {Timestamp} - Plan {5 word summary}
        {AI-generated plan with numbered steps}
        ```

        ### Summary

        {AI-generated summary of the plan, code examples are welcome here}

        ### Completed Steps

        * [x]: The current timestamp (HH:MM).  The AI should generate this.
        
        ### Next Steps

        * [ ]: The current timestamp (HH:MM).  The AI should generate this.
        

3. **Execution Phase:**
    The user will give a go-ahead on the plan. Example the tasks that are unfinished [ ]. and once finishing them mark them as [x] and move them to the section Completed Steps with a timestamp.

4. **Logging Phase:**
    * After executing all steps, the AI will add a summary of the execution:

        ```markdown
        ### Summary
        {Summary of the executed plan and results}
        ```

        * The AI should provide the summary
