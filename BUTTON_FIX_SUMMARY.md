# Button Display Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Complete button (and other runtime buttons) were not appearing in the timer control because the runtime execution flow was broken at the `PopBlockAction` level.

## Root Cause
The `PopBlockAction` only called `runtime.pop()` but didn't continue execution flow. When the `IdleRuntimeBlock` was popped after the user clicked the Run button, the `RootBlock` that remained on the stack never had its `next()` method called to continue with pushing workout statements.

## Execution Flow (Before Fix)
1. ✅ `IdleRuntimeBlock` creates system buttons ([Run])
2. ✅ User clicks Run button → triggers `PushNextAction`
3. ✅ `IdleRuntimeBlock.onNext()` returns `PopBlockAction`
4. ❌ `PopBlockAction` only calls `runtime.pop()` - execution stops
5. ❌ `RootBlock.onNext()` never called
6. ❌ No workout statements pushed (no `EffortBlock` created)
7. ❌ No runtime buttons ([Complete]) appear

## Execution Flow (After Fix)
1. ✅ `IdleRuntimeBlock` creates system buttons ([Run])
2. ✅ User clicks Run button → triggers `PushNextAction`
3. ✅ `IdleRuntimeBlock.onNext()` returns `PopBlockAction`
4. ✅ `PopBlockAction` calls `runtime.pop()` + `currentBlock.next()`
5. ✅ `RootBlock.onNext()` called after `IdleRuntimeBlock` popped
6. ✅ `RootBlock` pushes workout statements → creates `EffortBlock`
7. ✅ `EffortBlock.onEnter()` creates runtime buttons ([Complete])
8. ✅ Complete button appears in timer control!

## Code Changes
**File: `x:\wod-wiki\src\core\runtime\actions\PopBlockAction.ts`**

### Before:
```typescript
export class PopBlockAction implements IRuntimeAction {
  name: string = "pop";
  apply(runtime: ITimerRuntime, _input: Subject<IRuntimeEvent>, _output: Subject<OutputEvent>): void {
    runtime.pop();
  }
}
```

### After:
```typescript
export class PopBlockAction implements IRuntimeAction {
  name: string = "pop";
  apply(runtime: ITimerRuntime, _input: Subject<IRuntimeEvent>, _output: Subject<OutputEvent>): void {
    const poppedBlock = runtime.pop();
    
    // After popping a block, call next() on the current block to continue execution
    const currentBlock = runtime.trace.current();
    if (currentBlock && poppedBlock) {
      const nextActions = currentBlock.next(runtime);
      if (nextActions && nextActions.length > 0) {
        runtime.apply(nextActions, currentBlock);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Fixes the missing Complete button issue**
- ✅ **Restores proper runtime execution flow**
- ✅ **Maintains backward compatibility**
- ✅ **No breaking changes to existing API**
- ✅ **Proper event-driven architecture preserved**

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No compilation errors
- The button display system now works as designed
- Runtime execution flow is restored

The fix ensures that when any block is popped from the runtime stack, execution continues with the next block in the hierarchy, which is the expected behavior for a stack-based execution model.
