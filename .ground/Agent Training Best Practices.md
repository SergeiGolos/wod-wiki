# Architecting Agentic Intelligence: A Guide to System Prompts and Instructional Design for GPT-5 and Claude Models

## Part I: The Anatomy of an LLM Agent

The development of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) represents a significant paradigm shift in artificial
intelligence, moving from single-purpose models to dynamic systems
capable of complex problem-solving.<sup>1</sup> To effectively harness
these capabilities, particularly with advanced models such as OpenAI's
GPT-5 and Anthropic's Claude series, it is essential to move beyond a
monolithic view of the LLM. Instead, an agent must be understood as a
modular, neuro-symbolic system, where the "training documents"—the
system prompt, tool definitions, and contextual examples—function as the
architectural blueprints and configuration files for a distributed
cognitive apparatus. This systemic perspective is foundational to
building robust, predictable, and effective agents.

### Section 1: Deconstructing the Modern Agent

An LLM-powered agent is not merely a language model; it is a composite
architecture comprising several distinct but interconnected components.
Each component serves a specific function, and the instructions provided
by the developer must be tailored to configure and guide each one. This
modular decomposition is a recurring theme in both academic research and
industry best practices, forming a consensus on the fundamental
structure of agentic systems.<sup>3</sup> Anthropic formalizes this
distinction by separating simple, predefined "workflows" from true
"agents," which dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage,
underscoring the shift towards systems with greater autonomy and
complexity.<sup>5</sup>

#### 1.1 The LLM as the Cognitive Core: Reasoning, Decision-Making, and Control

At the heart of every agent is the LLM, which serves as the "brain" or
central cognitive core.<sup>3</sup> This component acts as the primary
controller, orchestrating the flow of operations required to fulfill a
user's request.<sup>3</sup> It functions as a reasoning engine,
interpreting the user's intent, formulating a high-level plan, and
determining which actions to take and what inputs are necessary for
those actions.<sup>6</sup> Academic surveys consistently frame the LLM
as the cognitive engine within a broader computational framework,
responsible for high-level reasoning, planning, and natural language
understanding that bridges the gap between user intent and system
execution.<sup>2</sup> The initial instructions provided to this
core—the system prompt—are therefore the most critical element in
defining the agent's purpose, capabilities, and boundaries.

#### 1.2 The Planning Module: From Simple Chain-of-Thought to Complex Multi-Path Reasoning

To tackle complex, multi-step tasks, an agent requires a planning module
that decomposes the primary goal into a sequence of manageable
subtasks.<sup>3</sup> This decomposition enables the agent to reason
more effectively and reliably construct a path to a
solution.<sup>3</sup> The evolution of planning capabilities is central
to the advancement of agentic intelligence.

Foundational techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are used
to induce a step-by-step reasoning process, compelling the model to
"think out loud" and articulate its logical progression before arriving
at a final answer.<sup>9</sup> This simple yet powerful method improves
performance on tasks requiring detailed deliberation.

More advanced frameworks introduce environmental feedback to create a
dynamic and adaptive planning loop. The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
framework, for example, interleaves a series of Thought, Action, and
Observation steps.<sup>3</sup> In this cycle, the agent first reasons
about the task (

Thought), then executes a tool or action (Action), and finally processes
the feedback from the environment (Observation). This iterative process
allows the agent to correct mistakes, refine its plan, and adapt to
unforeseen circumstances. Further research explores the use of dedicated
"reflection agents" that can analyze an agent's past actions and
observations to critique its performance and suggest improvements for
future steps, creating a mechanism for self-correction and continuous
learning.<sup>12</sup> Consequently, instructional documents must not
only issue commands but also guide this dynamic, iterative planning and
refinement process.

#### 1.3 The Memory Imperative: Architecting Short-Term and Long-Term Memory

An agent's ability to maintain context and learn from past interactions
is governed by its memory architecture. This architecture is typically
bifurcated into two distinct systems:

- **Short-Term Memory:** This is realized through in-context learning,
  where information is stored within the model's finite context
  window.<sup>3</sup> This "working memory" is volatile and constrained
  by the token limit of the specific LLM being used. The challenge of
  finite context length is a significant bottleneck, directly limiting
  an agent's ability to reason over long conversations or large
  documents without external assistance.<sup>3</sup>

- **Long-Term Memory:** To overcome the limitations of the context
  window, agents are equipped with long-term memory, which involves
  retaining and recalling information over extended periods. This is
  most commonly implemented using an external vector store.<sup>3</sup>
  Past thoughts, actions, and key pieces of information are converted
  into numerical representations (embeddings) and stored in a database
  that can be queried for semantically similar information. This allows
  the agent to retrieve relevant memories as needed, effectively
  augmenting its limited short-term context.

The critical role of memory is underscored by the extensive body of
research dedicated to this area, with ongoing work exploring advanced
concepts like memory-augmented training, editable memory graphs, and
hierarchical working memory to enhance long-range reasoning and
experience accumulation.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, the design of an
agent's instructional documents must account for both the immediate
context provided in a prompt and the mechanisms for retrieving and
utilizing knowledge from its long-term memory store.

#### 1.4 The Agent-Computer Interface (ACI): Tools as the Agent's Bridge to the World

For an agent to effect change or gather information beyond its internal
knowledge, it requires tools. These tools serve as the agent's bridge to
the external world, functioning as its hands and eyes.<sup>3</sup> They
can range from simple utilities like a math calculator or a calendar API
to complex systems like a code interpreter, a web search engine, or
proprietary databases.<sup>4</sup>

Anthropic places particular emphasis on the design of the
**Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)**, arguing that it is as critical to an
agent's success as a Human-Computer Interface (HCI) is to a human
user.<sup>5</sup> A poorly designed or documented tool can confuse the
agent, leading it to make incorrect calls or fail to solve the task
entirely. The agent interacts with these tools by generating specially
formatted text, such as a JSON object or a specific function call
signature, which is then intercepted and executed by the surrounding
framework.<sup>18</sup> Agent development frameworks like LangChain,
LlamaIndex, and Haystack provide abstractions and infrastructure to
manage these complex interactions, simplifying the process of equipping
an agent with a robust set of tools.<sup>4</sup> The documentation for
these tools—their names, descriptions, and parameters—is not merely
metadata; it is a core component of the agent's instructional set,
directly influencing its ability to understand and utilize its
capabilities.

## Part II: The System Prompt as the Agent's Constitution

The system prompt is the foundational document that governs an agent's
behavior. It is a set of carefully crafted instructions, provided to the
model before it engages with any user input, that defines its core
identity, operational rules, and interaction style.<sup>19</sup> This
"constitution" acts as a guiding framework, shaping the agent's
personality and ensuring its outputs align with the developer's intended
goals.<sup>20</sup> A well-architected system prompt is the first and
most critical step toward building a reliable and predictable agent. Its
construction demands an engineering mindset, treating it not as a simple
piece of text but as a high-level configuration script for a complex
system. This involves principles of clarity, modularity, and rigorous
testing, akin to traditional software development.

### Section 2: The Foundational Role of the System Prompt

The system prompt serves multiple critical functions, from establishing
the agent's persona to enforcing strict safety guardrails. Its structure
and content directly influence every subsequent generation from the
model.

#### 2.1 Defining the Agent's Core Identity: Persona, Role, and Objective

The first function of a system prompt is to establish the agent's
persona. This involves explicitly defining its role, its objective, and
its personality.<sup>20</sup> For example, a prompt might begin with
"You are an expert software engineer specializing in Python" or "You are
a friendly and empathetic customer service assistant".<sup>22</sup> This
role-prompting sets the context for all subsequent
interactions.<sup>23</sup>

Analysis of system prompts used by major AI labs reveals how distinct
identities are crafted. Anthropic's Claude models, for instance, are
instructed to be "helpful, harmless, and honest," a directive that
underpins their entire operational philosophy.<sup>25</sup> In contrast,
the prompt for xAI's Grok explicitly encourages it to provide nuanced,
multi-perspective analyses for complex questions rather than refusing to
answer.<sup>26</sup> By clearly defining the agent's role and
overarching objective, developers can create a stable foundation for
predictable and consistent behavior.<sup>27</sup>

#### 2.2 Establishing Operational Guardrails: Rules, Constraints, and Prohibited Actions

System prompts are the primary mechanism for implementing behavioral
guardrails and enforcing operational constraints.<sup>20</sup> These
instructions serve as a layer of defense, directing the model on what
actions are permitted and, crucially, what actions are forbidden. This
can include rules to prevent the leakage of personally identifiable
information (PII), prohibitions against generating malicious code, or
instructions to avoid specific topics.<sup>24</sup>

Different models offer different levels of control. OpenAI provides an
"instruction hierarchy" that allows developer-defined commands in the
prompt to take precedence, ensuring that custom guardrails are
respected.<sup>29</sup> Anthropic's models, guided by the principles of
Constitutional AI, have extensive safety clauses built into their system
prompts, detailing how to handle sensitive topics, when to refuse a
request, and under what conditions a conversation should be
terminated.<sup>25</sup> These explicit rules are essential for
deploying agents safely and responsibly in production environments.

#### 2.3 Dictating Tone, Style, and Communication Protocols

Beyond high-level identity and safety, the system prompt provides
granular control over the agent's communication style. It can specify a
tone (e.g., formal, technical, witty, empathetic) and a format for
responses (e.g., JSON, XML, markdown, bulleted lists).<sup>20</sup> To
avoid confusing the model, it is a best practice to separate potentially
conflicting instructions. For instance, instead of a vague directive
like "Be friendly, formal, and technical," the prompt should be broken
down into clear, distinct rules: "Tone: Always be friendly and
respectful. Style: Provide detailed technical explanations when
requested.".<sup>22</sup> This clarity ensures that the model can adhere
to each guideline without ambiguity. The prompt can also mandate
specific output structures, such as requiring all code samples to be
enclosed in markdown blocks or all structured data to be returned as a
valid JSON object, which is critical for programmatic interaction with
the agent's output.<sup>24</sup>

#### 2.4 Structuring the Prompt: The Power of Markdown, XML, and Hierarchical Instructions

The physical structure of the system prompt is as important as its
content. Different models are optimized to parse different formats, and
adhering to these conventions can significantly improve instruction
following.

For OpenAI's models, the recommended practice is to use Markdown to
create a clear, hierarchical structure.<sup>31</sup> A typical prompt is
organized into sections with headings like

Role and Objective, Instructions, Examples, and Context.<sup>9</sup>
This organization helps the model differentiate between high-level
goals, specific rules, and contextual information.

Anthropic's Claude models, by contrast, have been specifically
fine-tuned to pay close attention to XML tags.<sup>11</sup> Using tags
like

\<instruction\>, \<example\>, and \<document\> to encapsulate different
parts of the prompt is the most effective way to ensure that Claude
correctly interprets the developer's intent. This structured approach
allows for the clear delineation of complex instructions and is a
cornerstone of effective prompting for the Claude ecosystem.

### Section 3: Crafting High-Fidelity Instructions

The quality of an agent's performance is directly proportional to the
quality of its instructions. High-fidelity instructions are precise,
actionable, and structured in a way that facilitates logical
decomposition of the task at hand.

#### 3.1 The Principle of Unambiguous Precision: Eliminating "Fluff" and Vague Language

A universal best practice across all advanced LLMs is the elimination of
ambiguity. Instructions must be clear, direct, and precise.<sup>22</sup>
Vague or "fluffy" language can lead to inconsistent or incorrect
behavior. For example, an ineffective prompt like "The description for
this product should be fairly short" should be replaced with a precise
instruction like "Use a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph to describe this
product.".<sup>24</sup>

This principle is particularly critical for newer models like GPT-4.1
and its successors, which are designed to follow instructions with a
high degree of literalness.<sup>9</sup> These models do not rely heavily
on inferring user intent from context; they execute the instructions as
written. Therefore, any ambiguity in the prompt is likely to be
reflected as a "bug" in the agent's output. The developer must assume
the model will not "guess" the intended meaning and must instead provide
unequivocal directives.

#### 3.2 From Negative to Positive Framing: Instructing "What to Do" vs. "What Not to Do"

A powerful technique for improving instruction fidelity is to frame
directives positively, specifying what the agent *should* do rather than
only what it *should not* do. While negative constraints are necessary
for safety, they can leave the model without a clear path forward.

For instance, an instruction like "DO NOT ASK THE USER FOR THEIR
PASSWORD" is a valid negative constraint. However, a more effective
instruction provides a positive alternative: "The agent will attempt to
diagnose the problem... whilst refraining from asking any questions
related to PII. Instead of asking for PII, such as username or password,
refer the user to the help article at
[<u>www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq</u>](https://www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq).".<sup>24</sup>
This positive framing gives the agent a constructive action to take when
it encounters the prohibited situation, reducing the likelihood of it
becoming stuck or responding unhelpfully.

#### 3.3 Task Decomposition: Breaking Down Complex Goals into Verifiable Steps

For any task of non-trivial complexity, the system prompt should guide
the agent to decompose the problem into a logical sequence of smaller,
verifiable steps.<sup>5</sup> This is the essence of prompting-induced
planning and is a key driver of reliable performance in agentic
workflows. By instructing the model to create and follow a plan, the
developer makes the reasoning process more explicit and less prone to
error.

For example, a system prompt for a software engineering agent might
explicitly outline a multi-stage workflow:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Rephrase the user's request to confirm
    understanding.

2.  **Gather Context:** Use tools to search for relevant files and
    functions in the codebase.

3.  **Develop a Detailed Plan:** Outline a specific, verifiable sequence
    of steps to implement the fix.

4.  **Execute Code Changes:** Make small, incremental changes, reading
    the relevant file contents before each edit.

5.  **Verify the Solution:** Run tests to confirm the fix is correct and
    has not introduced regressions.

This level of procedural detail, embedded directly in the prompt,
transforms a vague request into a structured, repeatable process,
significantly increasing the agent's chances of success.<sup>10</sup>

## Part III: Advanced Instructional Methodologies

While the system prompt forms the agent's static constitution, its
capabilities can be dynamically enhanced at runtime through advanced
instructional methodologies. These techniques augment the agent's
context with behavioral examples, external knowledge, and procedural
capabilities, enabling it to tackle more complex and knowledge-intensive
tasks. The strategic combination of In-Context Learning (ICL),
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and well-designed tools forms a
complementary triad for context augmentation. ICL provides *behavioral*
context by demonstrating desired input-output patterns. RAG provides
*declarative knowledge* context by grounding the agent in factual data.
Tools provide *procedural* context by defining the actions the agent can
take. An advanced agent's instructional design must orchestrate these
three forms of context to achieve peak performance.

### Section 4: Mastering In-Context Learning (ICL)

In-Context Learning (ICL) is a powerful technique that allows a model to
learn a new task or behavior directly from examples provided within the
prompt, without requiring any updates to its underlying
weights.<sup>33</sup> It leverages the model's pattern-recognition
abilities to generalize from a few demonstrations.

#### 4.1 The Spectrum of Demonstration: From Zero-Shot to Many-Shot Prompting

ICL exists on a spectrum defined by the number of examples, or "shots,"
provided in the prompt:

- **Zero-Shot Prompting:** The model is given a direct instruction
  without any examples.<sup>33</sup> This relies entirely on the model's
  pre-trained knowledge and its ability to follow instructions, which
  has been significantly improved through techniques like instruction
  tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
  (RLHF).<sup>36</sup>

- **One-Shot and Few-Shot Prompting:** This is the direct application of
  ICL, where one (one-shot) or multiple (few-shot) input-output examples
  are included in the prompt to demonstrate the desired
  behavior.<sup>33</sup> Providing even a few examples can dramatically
  improve accuracy and consistency, especially for tasks with specific
  formatting or stylistic requirements.<sup>33</sup>

- **Many-Shot Prompting:** The advent of models with extremely long
  context windows (e.g., 200k to 1M+ tokens) has enabled "many-shot"
  ICL, where hundreds or even thousands of examples can be
  provided.<sup>37</sup> Research indicates that scaling from few-shot
  to many-shot can yield significant performance gains, help the model
  learn more complex functions, and even override biases learned during
  pre-training.<sup>37</sup>

#### 4.2 Designing Effective Examples: Best Practices for Selection, Formatting, and Diversity

The efficacy of ICL is highly dependent on the quality and presentation
of the examples. Crafting an effective set of demonstrations requires
careful consideration of several factors:

- **Quality and Relevance:** Examples must be high-quality, accurate,
  and directly relevant to the target task.<sup>34</sup> For instance, a
  sentiment analysis agent for movie reviews should be given examples of
  movie reviews, not product reviews.

- **Format Consistency:** The format used to present the examples plays
  a key role in performance. A consistent structure (e.g., Input:
  \[text\] \n Output: \[label\]) helps the model understand the
  relationship between the input and the desired output.<sup>33</sup>

- **Diversity and Distribution:** The set of examples should be diverse,
  covering a range of possible inputs and edge cases to improve the
  model's ability to generalize.<sup>38</sup> It is also important to
  provide a balanced distribution of output labels or types to avoid
  biasing the model towards a specific outcome.<sup>34</sup>

- **Order:** The order in which examples are presented can sometimes
  affect performance. While random ordering is a good starting point,
  some research suggests that selecting examples that are most
  semantically similar to the user's query can be
  beneficial.<sup>33</sup>

#### 4.3 Avoiding Common Pitfalls: Overgeneralization, Superficial Pattern Matching, and Context Window Limitations

Despite its power, ICL has inherent limitations that developers must
navigate:

- **Context Window Constraints:** The number of examples that can be
  included is fundamentally limited by the model's context window
  size.<sup>33</sup>

- **Overgeneralization:** If the provided examples are too similar or
  lack diversity, the model may overgeneralize and fail on inputs that
  deviate even slightly from the demonstrated patterns.<sup>33</sup>

- **Superficial Pattern Matching:** LLMs may sometimes focus on
  superficial patterns in the examples (e.g., the length of the output
  or the presence of certain keywords) rather than understanding the
  underlying logic of the task.<sup>33</sup> This is particularly a risk
  for complex reasoning tasks, where a few examples may be insufficient
  to convey the required logical steps.<sup>39</sup>

### Section 5: Grounding Agents in Reality with RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical framework for
building agents that require access to external, up-to-date, or
proprietary knowledge. It grounds the agent's responses in factual data,
significantly improving accuracy and reducing the incidence of
"hallucinations."

#### 5.1 Integrating External Knowledge: The RAG Pipeline Explained

RAG combines the strengths of a retrieval system (like a search engine)
with a generative LLM.<sup>40</sup> The process typically involves two
main stages:

1.  **Retrieval:** When the agent receives a query, it first uses a
    retrieval mechanism to search an external knowledge base (e.g., a
    collection of company documents, a product manual, or a technical
    knowledge base) for information relevant to the query.

2.  **Augmented Generation:** The retrieved information (or "context")
    is then inserted into the prompt alongside the original query and
    sent to the LLM. The LLM uses this provided context to generate a
    response that is "grounded" in the retrieved facts.<sup>41</sup>

This approach is a primary method for providing an agent with
domain-specific knowledge without the need for expensive model
fine-tuning.<sup>40</sup>

#### 5.2 Building a High-Quality RAG Corpus for Factual Accuracy

The performance of a RAG system is fundamentally dependent on the
quality and structure of its knowledge corpus. Building this corpus
involves several steps:

- **Data Ingestion and Pre-processing:** Documents are collected and
  prepared for the system. This often involves cleaning the text and
  "chunking" large documents into smaller, semantically coherent
  segments.<sup>41</sup>

- **Embedding and Indexing:** Each chunk is passed through an embedding
  model to create a high-dimensional vector representation. These
  vectors are then stored in a specialized vector database, which allows
  for efficient similarity search.<sup>41</sup> When the agent needs to
  retrieve information, it embeds the user's query and searches the
  database for the document chunks with the most similar vectors.

This pipeline is essential for giving agents access to private or
proprietary data that was not part of their original training
set.<sup>31</sup>

#### 5.3 Mitigating Hallucination and Ensuring Up-to-Date Information

RAG offers two primary advantages over relying solely on an LLM's
internal knowledge:

- **Reduced Hallucination:** By providing the model with relevant,
  factual documents from which to construct its answer, RAG
  significantly reduces the likelihood of the model fabricating
  information. The prompt can even instruct the model to base its answer
  *only* on the provided context, further enhancing factual
  accuracy.<sup>41</sup>

- **Access to Fresh Information:** An LLM's internal knowledge is static
  and becomes outdated as soon as its training is complete. A RAG
  system's knowledge base, however, can be continuously updated with new
  information, ensuring that the agent always has access to the most
  current data.<sup>41</sup>

### Section 6: Designing and Documenting Agent Tools

Tools are the agent's interface to the world, and their design and
documentation are critical for effective operation. The descriptions and
schemas provided for tools are not just metadata; they are instructions
that the LLM must interpret to understand its capabilities.

#### 6.1 The Docstring Philosophy: Writing Tool Descriptions for an LLM Audience

Tool descriptions should be written with the LLM as the intended
audience. This means they must be exceptionally clear, concise, and
explicit about the tool's purpose and functionality.<sup>5</sup> A
useful mental model is to think of writing a high-quality docstring for
a junior developer who has no prior context.<sup>5</sup> The description
should state what the tool does, when it should be used, and what its
limitations are. A vague or poorly written description is a common point
of failure, as it can easily mislead the agent into using the wrong tool
or using the right tool incorrectly.<sup>16</sup>

#### 6.2 Schema Design: Defining Clear and Concise Parameters

In addition to a good description, each tool must have a well-defined
input schema that specifies the parameters it accepts. Each parameter
needs a descriptive name and a clear description of its purpose and
expected format.<sup>10</sup> This is typically done using a standard
format like JSON Schema or by leveraging data validation libraries such
as Pydantic, as seen in frameworks like

claudetools.<sup>42</sup> A clear schema reduces the cognitive load on
the LLM, making it easier for the model to correctly format its tool-use
requests.

#### 6.3 Orchestration Logic: Managing Sequential Dependencies and Parallel Execution

A sophisticated agent must be able to orchestrate multiple tool calls to
solve a complex problem. This involves understanding the dependencies
between tools:

- **Sequential Tool Use:** This is required when the output of one tool
  is a necessary input for another. For example, an agent might first
  need to call a get_user_id tool before it can call a get_order_history
  tool that requires the user's ID.<sup>43</sup> The agent must
  recognize this dependency and execute the calls in the correct order.

- **Parallel Tool Use:** When multiple independent pieces of information
  are needed, the agent can call several tools in parallel to improve
  efficiency. For example, to answer "What is the weather in Paris and
  the time in Tokyo?", the agent could call
  get_weather(location="Paris") and get_time(location="Tokyo")
  simultaneously.<sup>43</sup>

Guiding this complex orchestration logic is a significant challenge in
agent design. While the system prompt can provide high-level strategies,
the agent's ability to correctly plan and execute multi-tool workflows
is a key measure of its reasoning capabilities.

## Part IV: Model-Specific Best Practices and Comparative Analysis

While general principles of agent design apply broadly, the specific
implementation details and prompting strategies differ significantly
between the OpenAI and Anthropic ecosystems. These differences stem from
their distinct architectural philosophies, training methodologies, and
API designs. Understanding these nuances is crucial for developing
high-performing agents on each platform. The divergent paths taken by
OpenAI and Anthropic—one prioritizing maximal capability and
steerability, the other prioritizing safety and reliability—result in a
fundamental dichotomy in prompt design. Crafting instructions for a
GPT-based agent is akin to imperative programming, requiring a detailed,
procedural script of actions. Conversely, designing for a Claude-based
agent is more like declarative or principle-based programming, where the
developer sets clear goals and constraints and trusts the agent to
reason its way to a solution within those boundaries. This distinction
should inform the entire strategy of how an agent's instructional
documents are architected.

### Section 7: Engineering Prompts for the OpenAI Ecosystem (GPT-4.1/5)

OpenAI's models, particularly from GPT-4.1 onwards, are characterized by
their power, versatility, and a high degree of steerability. However,
harnessing this power requires a prompting style that is exceptionally
precise and procedural.

#### 7.1 Embracing Literal Interpretation: The Need for Extreme Specificity

A defining characteristic of recent GPT models is their literal
interpretation of instructions. They do not heavily rely on implied
meaning or context to infer the user's intent; they execute the prompt
as written.<sup>9</sup> This has a critical implication for prompt
engineering: ambiguity is the enemy of reliability. Prompts that worked
well with older, more inferential models may fail or produce
inconsistent results with GPT-4.1 and its successors unless they are
updated to be more explicit.<sup>9</sup> Every instruction, constraint,
and desired output format must be stated unequivocally.

#### 7.2 Inducing "Thinking Out Loud": Forcing Explicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

OpenAI distinguishes between its "GPT" models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4.1)
and its "reasoning" models (e.g., o1, o3-mini). The GPT-series models
are optimized for speed and cost-efficiency and do not produce an
internal chain of thought by default.<sup>10</sup> To ensure robust
performance on complex tasks, developers must explicitly induce a
planning phase in the prompt. This can be achieved by including
instructions like "Think step by step before answering" or by providing
a structured planning template for the model to follow.<sup>9</sup> This
forces the model to "think out loud," making its reasoning process
transparent and often leading to more accurate results. For example, in
experiments on the SWE-bench coding benchmark, inducing explicit
planning increased the pass rate by 4%.<sup>10</sup> Newer models may
support more structured methods for this, such as the proposed

\<self_reflection\> tag for GPT-5, which instructs the model to create
and use an internal rubric to evaluate its own solution before
responding.<sup>45</sup>

#### 7.3 Leveraging the Planner/Doer Model Architecture (o-series vs. GPT-series)

A powerful and advanced strategy within the OpenAI ecosystem is to build
multi-agent systems that leverage the distinct strengths of different
model families. The recommended architecture involves a "Planner/Doer"
model:

- **The Planner:** A highly capable but slower and more expensive
  "reasoning model" (o-series) is used for the most critical tasks:
  high-level planning, strategizing, decomposing complex problems, and
  handling ambiguity.<sup>29</sup>

- **The Doer:** Faster, more cost-efficient "GPT models" are used for
  the execution of the well-defined subtasks generated by the
  planner.<sup>44</sup>

This hybrid approach optimizes for both performance and cost. The
"Planner" agent acts as an intelligent orchestrator, breaking down a
complex user request into a series of simple, explicit tasks, which are
then delegated to one or more "Doer" agents.

#### 7.4 Best Practices for the Assistants API and Tool-Calling

The OpenAI Assistants API provides a high-level abstraction for building
stateful agents, managing conversation history, and orchestrating tool
calls.<sup>46</sup> When using this API or implementing tool-calling
directly, several best practices apply:

- **Clear Tool Documentation:** As with any agent system, tools must
  have clear names and detailed descriptions in the description
  field.<sup>10</sup>

- **Separate Examples from Descriptions:** For complex tools that
  require usage examples, these examples should be placed in a dedicated
  \# Examples section within the system prompt, rather than cluttering
  the tool's description field. The description should remain thorough
  but concise.<sup>9</sup>

- **Encourage Tool Use:** The system prompt should explicitly encourage
  the agent to make full use of its tools to answer questions, which
  reduces the likelihood of it hallucinating or guessing an
  answer.<sup>10</sup>

### Section 8: Engineering Prompts for the Anthropic Ecosystem (Claude)

Anthropic's approach to agent design is heavily influenced by its focus
on safety, reliability, and the principles of Constitutional AI. This
leads to a distinct set of best practices for prompting Claude models.

#### 8.1 Harnessing XML for Structural Clarity

The most important model-specific technique for Claude is the use of XML
tags to structure the prompt. Claude models are specifically fine-tuned
to recognize and respect the boundaries created by tags like
\<document\>, \<instruction\>, \<example\>, and
\<thinking\>.<sup>11</sup> Encapsulating different parts of the prompt
in these tags is the most reliable way to communicate their purpose to
the model and ensure that instructions are followed correctly. This
structured formatting is a cornerstone of the Anthropic prompting
methodology.

#### 8.2 Encouraging Internal Monologue with \<thinking\> Tags

A key technique for improving Claude's performance on complex reasoning
tasks is to instruct it to perform a "chain of thought" analysis
internally before producing the final answer. This is achieved by
telling the model to "think step-by-step within
\<thinking\>\</thinking\> tags".<sup>32</sup> The model will then
generate its reasoning process inside this block, which can be
programmatically hidden from the end-user. This allows Claude to
deliberate on the problem, consider different approaches, and refine its
plan, leading to a higher-quality final output without exposing the
intermediate reasoning steps.<sup>32</sup>

#### 8.3 The "Start Simple" Philosophy: Building Complexity Incrementally

Anthropic explicitly advises developers to maintain simplicity in their
agent's design. The recommended workflow is to start with the simplest
possible solution, such as a direct API call with a well-crafted prompt,
and only add layers of agentic complexity—like prompt chaining or
multi-agent systems—when the simpler approach proves
insufficient.<sup>5</sup> This principle of incremental complexity helps
to create agents that are more reliable, maintainable, and easier to
debug.

#### 8.4 Implications of Constitutional AI on Agent Behavior and Safety

Claude's behavior is fundamentally shaped by Constitutional AI, a
training methodology where the model learns to align its responses with
a set of explicit ethical principles (the "constitution").<sup>50</sup>
This has several implications for developers:

- **Inherent Safety:** Claude models have strong, built-in safety
  guardrails. They are more likely to refuse to answer prompts that are
  borderline or could be interpreted as harmful.<sup>52</sup>

- **The "Alignment Tax":** This focus on safety can sometimes lead to
  the model being overly cautious, refusing harmless prompts or
  providing hedged answers.<sup>51</sup> Developers must be aware of
  this "alignment tax" and may need to craft prompts that reassure the
  model of the harmless nature of the request.

- **Principle-Based Prompting:** Because the model is already aligned
  with a set of principles, prompts can be more declarative, focusing on
  the goal and high-level constraints, and trusting the model to find a
  safe and helpful path to the solution. The system prompts for Claude
  reflect this, with extensive sections on safety protocols, handling
  sensitive topics, and ethical considerations.<sup>25</sup>

### Section 9: A Comparative Performance Analysis

Choosing between OpenAI and Anthropic models for an agentic task
requires a nuanced understanding of their relative strengths and
weaknesses across key capabilities.

#### 9.1 Instruction Following and Reasoning: A Head-to-Head Benchmark Review

On standardized academic benchmarks, Claude 3 Opus has demonstrated a
notable advantage over GPT-4, particularly in tasks requiring advanced
reasoning. For example, on the GPQA benchmark for graduate-level
reasoning, Claude 3 Opus scored significantly higher than
GPT-4.<sup>54</sup> It also shows a lead in benchmarks that test
reasoning over text.<sup>54</sup> However, this does not always
translate to all practical applications. Some anecdotal evidence and
user reports suggest that for certain types of complex logical problems
or mathematical reasoning, GPT-4's performance remains highly
competitive or even superior.<sup>56</sup>

#### 9.2 Coding and Tool Use: Assessing Reliability and Efficiency

In the domain of coding, benchmarks like HumanEval show a clear
advantage for Claude 3 Opus, which significantly outperforms
GPT-4.<sup>54</sup> Aider's code editing benchmark also shows Opus
completing a higher percentage of tasks successfully.<sup>58</sup> Users
often report that Opus provides more direct, "to the point" code and is
less likely to backtrack or propose entirely new solutions when asked
for a modification.<sup>58</sup> Conversely, GPT-4 is sometimes
described as more versatile, less prone to returning errors on certain
coding tasks, and possessing a more robust ecosystem of developer
tools.<sup>58</sup>

#### 9.3 Long-Context Recall and Utilization: A Critical Differentiator

The ability to process and recall information from long contexts is a
critical differentiator, especially for agents that must analyze large
documents or maintain extended conversations. This is a key area of
strength for the Claude 3 family, which offers a 200k token context
window and has demonstrated near-perfect recall (over 99%) in "Needle In
a Haystack" (NIAH) tests.<sup>58</sup> In some cases, Claude has even
identified that the "needle" was an artificially inserted fact,
showcasing a deep level of contextual understanding.<sup>58</sup> In
contrast, research has shown that GPT-4's recall performance can degrade
significantly when the relevant information is located in the middle of
a long document, a phenomenon known as the "lost in the middle"
problem.<sup>58</sup> This gives Claude a distinct advantage for agentic
use cases that depend on high-fidelity recall over large volumes of
text.

#### 9.4 Proposed Table: GPT vs. Claude - A Synthesis of Agentic Capabilities

The following table synthesizes the key differences between the OpenAI
and Anthropic approaches to agent design, providing actionable
implications for the creation of their respective "training documents."

| **Capability/Dimension** | **OpenAI Approach (GPT-4.1/5)** | **Anthropic Approach (Claude 3/4)** | **Key "Training Document" Implication** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Core Philosophy** | Maximizing capability and steerability via RLHF. Literal instruction following. | Safety and reliability via Constitutional AI. Collaborative reasoning. | GPT prompts must be hyper-specific and procedural. Claude prompts can be more principle-based and rely on its inherent safety alignment. |
| **Prompt Structuring** | Markdown, hierarchical headings (Role, Instructions, Examples, Context). | Heavy reliance on XML tags (\<instruction\>, \<example\>) to delineate sections. | Use the native format for each model to ensure optimal parsing and instruction adherence. |
| **Reasoning Induction** | Must be explicitly induced via "think step-by-step" prompts for GPT-series. "Reasoning models" (o-series) think internally. | Encouraged via \<thinking\> tags for an internal monologue. CoT is a natural behavior for top models. | For GPT, planning must be an explicit output. For Claude, planning can be an internal process guided by the prompt. |
| **Tool Use / ACI** | Robust function-calling API. Planner/Doer model separation is a key strategy. | Focus on clear, well-documented tools and a simple ACI. Can handle parallel and sequential tool calls. | Tool documentation (descriptions, parameters) is a critical part of the prompt for both. OpenAI's architecture suggests using different models for planning vs. execution. |
| **Long-Context Handling** | Performance can degrade in the middle of long contexts ("lost in the middle"). | A key strength. Excellent recall over very large (200k+) context windows. | For GPT, place critical instructions at the beginning or end of long contexts. Claude is more robust for tasks requiring recall from large documents. |
| **Safety & Guardrails** | Moderation API and developer-defined guardrails in the prompt. | Baked into the model via Constitutional AI. Tends to be more cautious and refuse borderline prompts. | Prompts for GPT agents may need more explicit safety instructions. Developers using Claude must account for its "alignment tax" (potential for over-refusal). |

## Part V: Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations

Building a production-grade LLM agent is an engineering discipline that
requires a systematic approach to designing, testing, and maintaining
its core instructional documents. The preceding analysis provides the
foundational knowledge and model-specific tactics necessary for this
task. This final section synthesizes these components into a unified,
actionable framework for developers, offering a step-by-step guide to
agent construction and strategies for ensuring long-term success in a
rapidly evolving technological landscape.

### Section 10: A Unified Framework for Agent Document Design

The creation of an agent's instructional set should follow a structured,
multi-stage process that considers all aspects of its architecture, from
its high-level persona to the granular details of its tools and
knowledge base.

#### 10.1 A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Comprehensive Agent Instruction Set

1.  **Define Agent Persona and Core Objective:** Begin by clearly
    articulating the agent's purpose, role, and personality. This will
    form the introductory section of the system prompt and guide all
    subsequent design decisions.

2.  **Select the Right Model Architecture:** Determine the required
    level of complexity. Is a single agent sufficient, or does the task
    warrant a more complex multi-agent system, such as OpenAI's
    Planner/Doer architecture? The choice of architecture will dictate
    the structure of the instructional documents.

3.  **Draft the System Prompt (Constitution):** Write the core system
    prompt, incorporating the agent's persona, operational guardrails,
    communication style, and output format requirements. Structure the
    prompt according to model-specific best practices (Markdown for
    OpenAI, XML for Anthropic).

4.  **Design and Document Tools (ACI):** Identify all external actions
    the agent needs to perform. For each tool, write a clear, concise
    description and a well-defined parameter schema. Treat this
    documentation as a critical part of the agent's instruction set.

5.  **Curate Few-Shot Examples (Behavioral Training):** If the task
    involves nuanced behavior or specific output formats, create a set
    of high-quality few-shot examples to include in the prompt. Ensure
    these examples are diverse, relevant, and consistently formatted.

6.  **Assemble the RAG Corpus (Knowledge Base):** For
    knowledge-intensive tasks, build and index a corpus of documents for
    the agent to retrieve information from. This grounds the agent in
    factual, up-to-date knowledge and is a key method for controlling
    its information domain.

7.  **Implement, Test, and Iterate:** Deploy the agent with its full
    instructional set and begin a rigorous testing process to identify
    failure modes and areas for improvement.

#### 10.2 Strategies for Iteration, Testing, and Evaluation (Evals)

The development of an agent is not a one-time task but an iterative
cycle of refinement.<sup>22</sup> A robust testing and evaluation
strategy is essential for creating and maintaining a high-quality agent.

- **Build Evaluation Suites (evals):** Create a standardized set of test
  cases that cover the agent's core functionalities and common edge
  cases. These evals should be run automatically whenever the system
  prompt or the underlying model is updated to measure performance and
  detect regressions.<sup>31</sup>

- **Leverage Observability Tools:** As agentic systems become more
  complex, it is crucial to have tools to inspect their internal
  workings. Frameworks like LangSmith provide detailed tracing of an
  agent's thoughts, tool calls, and interactions, which is invaluable
  for debugging unexpected behavior.<sup>6</sup>

- **Use Models for Meta-Improvement:** Advanced models can be used to
  critique and improve their own instructional materials. For example,
  an agent can be tasked with testing a flawed tool and then rewriting
  its description to be clearer and less prone to misuse, a technique
  that has been shown to significantly improve task completion
  times.<sup>16</sup> OpenAI's Prompt Optimizer in the Playground is
  another tool that automates the application of best practices to
  existing prompts.<sup>61</sup>

#### 10.3 Future-Proofing Your Agent's Instructional Architecture

The field of LLM agents is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with new
models and techniques emerging constantly.<sup>18</sup> To avoid
building brittle systems, developers should design their agent's
instructional documents for maintainability and adaptability.

- **Version Control for Prompts:** Treat system prompts and tool
  descriptions as code. Store them in version control systems, track
  changes, and associate specific prompt versions with evaluation
  results.<sup>22</sup> This disciplined approach facilitates
  experimentation and allows for easy rollbacks if a change degrades
  performance.

- **Modular Prompt Design:** Structure prompts in a modular way,
  separating the agent's persona from its task-specific instructions and
  tool definitions. This makes it easier to update one aspect of the
  agent's behavior without affecting others and allows for the reuse of
  prompt components across different agents.

- **Prepare for Multi-Agent Systems:** The future of complex
  problem-solving likely involves systems of multiple, specialized
  agents collaborating to achieve a goal.<sup>63</sup> As these systems
  become more common, the need for standardized communication protocols
  and clear role definitions for each agent will become
  paramount.<sup>64</sup> Designing agents with a clear, narrow scope of
  responsibility today will make it easier to integrate them into
  larger, collaborative systems tomorrow.<sup>65</sup>

In conclusion, as the industry moves towards increasingly sophisticated
agentic systems, the challenges of cost, latency, reliability, and
ensuring robust alignment with human values will become more
acute.<sup>3</sup> The principles and practices outlined in this
report—viewing the agent as a system, approaching prompt design with an
engineering mindset, strategically augmenting context, and understanding
the deep philosophical differences between model ecosystems—provide a
durable framework for navigating these challenges and architecting the
next generation of intelligent agents.
