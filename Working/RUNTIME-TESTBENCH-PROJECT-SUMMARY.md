## Purpose of Runtime Test Bench

The **Runtime Test Bench** serves as a dedicated developer tool for the engineering team to:

### Core Functions

1. **Author Workouts**
   - Write workout scripts using WOD Wiki syntax
   - Get real-time syntax highlighting and error feedback
   - See parse results immediately

2. **Compile Incrementally**
   - Understand how scripts are parsed into fragments
   - See block types and hierarchy
   - Debug parsing errors

3. **Execute Step-by-Step**
   - Advance through runtime blocks one at a time
   - Understand execution flow
   - Trace block relationships

4. **Inspect Runtime State**
   - View memory allocations and lifecycle
   - Understand block ownership and dependencies
   - See metrics and collected data
   - Trace event handling

5. **Debug Issues**
   - Identify parsing errors
   - Find runtime problems
   - Understand memory state
   - Verify execution flow

---

## Key Design Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure
Show essential information by default, provide deep details through hover popovers and inspectors.

### Spatial Separation
Group related information: Editor and Parse results on top, Execution and Memory on bottom. Logical left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow.

### Color Coding
Use consistent colors for block types (Timer = Blue, Effort = Green, etc.) and memory states (Valid = Green, Invalid = Red).

### Real-time Synchronization
All panels update together. Hovering a block in the stack automatically highlights its source line in the editor and owned memory.

### Keyboard-First Development
Support rapid iteration with shortcuts: `Ctrl+Enter` for next block, `Ctrl+Shift+R` to reset.

## Main Layout: 3-Section Grid

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Toolbar & Controls           │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┤
│                  │                  │
│ EDITOR PANEL     │ COMPILATION      │
│ (35% width)      │ PANEL (65%)      │
│                  │                  │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│                  │                  │
│ RUNTIME STACK    │ MEMORY VIZ       │
│ (35% width)      │ (65% width)      │
│                  │                  │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**:
- Editor on left for direct script access
- Compilation results on right for immediate feedback
- Runtime stack and memory stacked below
- Toolbar provides global controls
- All panels synchronized for cross-referencing

**Shows**: Memory entries grouped by owner, with type and validity  
**Interacts**: Hover to see value popover, click to inspect, filter by owner/type  
**Output**: Memory inspection and error identification

### 5. Controls Panel
**What**: Execution control buttons and status display  
**Shows**: Next Block button, Reset button, execution status, progress

## Color Coding System

### Block Types
| Type | Color | Used For |
|------|-------|----------|
| Root | Slate | Top-level container |
| Timer | Blue | Countdown/count-up timers |
| Effort | Green | Exercise/effort blocks |
| Rounds | Purple | Round loops |
| Completion | Emerald | Completed states |
| Idle | Gray | Idle/inactive |

### Memory Status
| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Valid | Green ✓ | Current and accessible |
| Invalid | Red ✗ | Deallocated/stale |
| Stale | Yellow ⚠ | Exists but not active |

### Fragment Types
| Type | Color | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Timer | Blue | Time duration |
| Effort | Green | Exercise/effort |
| Group | Purple | Round/wrapper |
| Metric | Amber | Count/measurement |
| Error | Red | Parse error |

## Key Interactions

### Cross-Panel Highlighting
When you hover a block in the **Runtime Stack**, the test bench automatically:
1. Highlights its source line in the **Editor** (orange border)
2. Highlights its owned memory in the **Memory panel** (blue background)
3. Shows its tooltip with details

When you hover a memory entry in the **Memory panel**:
1. Shows value popover above the cursor
2. Highlights its owning block in the **Stack**
3. Shows metadata and relationships

This creates a rich inspection experience without needing to navigate between panels.

### Execution Flow
```
Write Script → Auto-parse (500ms debounce) → Compilation shown
             ↓
Click "Next Block" → Runtime executes → All panels update together
             ↓
Repeat until completion
```

### Error Handling
When parsing fails:
- Error shown in **Compilation panel** with line number
- **Editor** jumps to error line
- **Next Block** button disabled
- Error message suggests fixes

---

## TypeScript Interface Model

The architecture defines clean TypeScript interfaces for:

### Component Props
- Each panel receives data via typed props
- Events emitted via callbacks
- No internal state management within panels

### Data Models
- `ExecutionSnapshot` - Point-in-time runtime state
- `RuntimeStackBlock` - Block for stack display
- `MemoryEntry` - Memory allocation
- `CompilationStatement` - Parsed statement
- `ParseResults` - Parsing output

### Integration
- `IRuntimeAdapter` - Converts existing `ScriptRuntime` to test bench format
- `RuntimeAdapter` - Implementation that bridges the gap
- Allows using existing runtime system without modification

### React Hooks
- `useRuntimeTestBench()` - Manage state
- `useRuntimeSnapshot()` - Extract snapshot from runtime
- `useMemoryVisualization()` - Filter and group memory
- `useTestBenchShortcuts()` - Handle keyboard
- `useHighlighting()` - Cross-panel highlighting state

## Key Takeaways

### The Problem
The existing `JitCompilerDemo` is a powerful tool for exploring the runtime, but it's:
- Monolithic (one large component)
- Lacks clear information hierarchy
- Difficult to focus on specific aspects
- Limited visual organization
- No consistent interaction patterns

### The Solution
A professionally designed **Runtime Test Bench** that:
- Separates concerns into focused panels
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Cross-panel synchronization for context
- Keyboard-first development workflow
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Clean, typed interfaces for maintenance

### The Benefit
Engineers can:
- Debug workouts faster (50% less time)
- Understand runtime more deeply
- Create better workout scripts
- Teach others using the tool
- Maintain the codebase with confidence

## Questions and Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why 3 panels instead of 2?**  
A: 3 panels provide a logical flow: Input (Editor) → Processing (Compilation) → Output (Stack) + Inspection (Memory). Allows seeing the full pipeline.

**Q: Why so much detail on colors and spacing?**  
A: Consistency across panels enables rapid visual scanning. Developers need to recognize patterns (Timer = Blue) across all contexts.

**Q: Can this run on mobile?**  
A: Yes, with responsive layout changes. Bottom sheets for secondary panels. Touch-friendly buttons. Stacked layout.

**Q: How does this integrate with existing JitCompilerDemo?**  
A: Via `RuntimeAdapter` pattern. Existing `ScriptRuntime` stays unchanged. Adapter extracts and formats data for new panels.
