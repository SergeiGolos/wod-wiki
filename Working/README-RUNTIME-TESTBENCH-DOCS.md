## 🎯 Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### Layout: Why 3-Section (not 2 or 4)?

**Chosen**: 3-Section Layout
```
Editor (35%) | Compilation (65%)
Stack (35%)  | Memory (65%)
```

**Why**:
- Editor needed on left for quick script access
- Compilation on right for immediate feedback on editing
- Stack shows execution context
- Memory shows runtime state
- All visible simultaneously
- Fits well on most monitor sizes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 2-section: Would hide too much information
- 4-section: Would be too cluttered
- Tabbed: Would hide important context

---

### Data Flow: Why Adapter Pattern?

**Chosen**: Adapter Pattern (`IRuntimeAdapter`)
```
ScriptRuntime (unchanged)
    ↓
RuntimeAdapter (new)
    ↓
RuntimeTestBench (new)
```

**Why**:
- Doesn't modify existing `ScriptRuntime`
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to test independently
- Can swap implementations
- Existing code continues to work

**Alternative**: Direct dependency on ScriptRuntime (rejected because of tight coupling)

---

### Memory Display: Why Grouped by Owner?

**Chosen**: Group by Owner Block
```
Owner: blk-timer-001 (15 entries)
  • metric_001
  • timer-state_001
  • handlers_001

Owner: blk-effort-001 (12 entries)
  • metric_002
  • loop-state_001
```

**Why**:
- Shows memory ownership clearly
- Helps understand block dependencies
- Easier to debug ownership issues
- Organized, scannable layout

**Alternative**: Flat list (rejected - too hard to understand relationships)

## 📞 Support & Questions

### Common Questions Answered

**Q: Where do I start building?**  
A: Start with `INTERFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md` to define your types, then `VISUAL-DESIGN-GUIDE.md` to understand how things look, then `UI-REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 3 for each panel.

**Q: What's the main layout?**  
A: 3-section grid: Editor (35%) + Compilation (65%) on top, Stack (35%) + Memory (65%) on bottom.

**Q: How do I integrate with existing runtime?**  
A: Use the `RuntimeAdapter` pattern from `INTERFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md` Section 4. Don't modify `ScriptRuntime`.

**Q: What are the keyboard shortcuts?**  
A: See `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` or `UI-REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 6. Main: Ctrl+Enter (Next), Ctrl+Shift+R (Reset).

**Q: How do I make it responsive?**  
A: Follow the breakpoints in `VISUAL-DESIGN-GUIDE.md` Section 8 and `UI-REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 7.
