# ScriptRuntime Implementation Assessment

## Executive Summary

This assessment evaluates the current state of the ScriptRuntime implementation and identifies the remaining work needed to complete the system. The ScriptRuntime is partially implemented with core interfaces in place, but several critical components and integrations are missing or incomplete.

## Notes and Verification

This document's assessment has been verified against the current codebase and found to be accurate. The following points confirm the major gaps identified:

*   **`JitCompiler.ts`**: The `idle()` and `end()` methods are indeed not implemented. There is a mismatch between the constructor definition and its usage in `ScriptRuntime.ts`, confirming the dependency and type mismatch issues.
*   **`FragmentCompilationManager.ts`**: This file defines the manager but lacks the concrete `IFragmentCompiler` implementations required for it to function.
*   **`ScriptRuntime.ts`**: The event handling logic incorrectly uses a `canHandle` method that is not part of the `EventHandler` interface, which instead uses a `handleEvent` method.
*   **`EventHandler.ts`**: This file only contains interface definitions (`IRuntimeEvent`, `IRuntimeAction`, `HandlerResponse`, `EventHandler`) and no concrete handler implementations.

The assessment's recommendations for the next steps are therefore valid and address the most critical issues.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Core Interfaces**
   - `IScriptRuntime` - Well-defined with script, stack, and jit properties
   - `IRuntimeBlock` - Complete interface with all required methods
   - `RuntimeStack` - Fully implemented with push/pop operations
   - `EventHandler` interface - Comprehensive event handling pattern

2. **Basic Runtime Structure**
   - `ScriptRuntime` class exists with proper constructor
   - Stack management working correctly
   - Event handling pipeline established

3. **Block Infrastructure**
   - Multiple runtime block types implemented (IdleRuntimeBlock, DoneRuntimeBlock, RootBlock, etc.)
   - Block inheritance patterns defined
   - Basic block composition working

4. **Testing Foundation**
   - Test files exist for key components
   - Storybook integration for visual validation
   - Runtime stack visualization working

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Components

1. **JitCompiler**
   - Class structure exists but many methods throw "not implemented" errors
   - Fragment compilation logic needs completion
   - Strategy management system partially working
   - Missing integration between phases

2. **FragmentCompilationManager**
   - Basic structure exists
   - Fragment compiler interface defined
   - Missing specific fragment type implementations

3. **Event Handling**
   - Event interfaces defined
   - Handler structure exists but missing concrete implementations
   - Action system partially defined

### ❌ Missing Critical Components

## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. JitCompiler Implementation Gaps

**Priority: High**

Current issues in `src/runtime/JitCompiler.ts`:

```typescript
// These methods throw errors instead of implementing functionality:
idle(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeBlock {
    throw new Error("IdleRuntimeBlock not implemented yet");
}

end(runtime: ITimerRuntime): IRuntimeBlock {
    throw new Error("DoneRuntimeBlock not implemented yet");
}
```

**Required Work:**
- Implement `idle()` method to return `IdleRuntimeBlock` instances
- Implement `end()` method to return `DoneRuntimeBlock` instances  
- Fix constructor to properly initialize dependencies
- Complete fragment compilation integration
- Implement proper error handling for compilation failures

### 2. Fragment Compilation System

**Priority: High**

Current `FragmentCompilationManager` is incomplete:

**Missing Components:**
- Concrete `IFragmentCompiler` implementations for each fragment type:
  - `TimeFragmentCompiler`
  - `DistanceFragmentCompiler`
  - `RepetitionFragmentCompiler`
  - `ResistanceFragmentCompiler`
  - `ActionFragmentCompiler`
- Fragment type registration system
- Compilation context implementation
- Error handling for invalid fragments

**Required Work:**
- Create specific fragment compiler classes
- Implement compilation logic for each fragment type
- Add validation and error handling
- Create fragment compiler factory/registry

### 3. Runtime Action System

**Priority: Medium**

The action system is partially defined but missing concrete implementations:

**Missing Components:**
- `PopBlockAction` class implementation
- `CompileAndPushAction` class implementation
- Action execution framework
- Action validation and error handling

**Current Issues:**
```typescript
// In ScriptRuntime.ts - incorrect event handler interface usage
const handlres = this.stack.blocks.flatMap(block => block.handlers)
const actions = handlres.find(handler => handler.canHandle(event))?.handle(event) ?? [];
```

The `canHandle` method doesn't exist in the current `EventHandler` interface.

### 4. Strategy Pattern Implementation

**Priority: Medium**

While basic strategies exist in `strategies.ts`, the system needs:

**Missing Components:**
- Complete strategy registration system
- Strategy priority and ordering
- Complex block type strategies (TimedGroupBlock, RepeatingBlock patterns)
- Strategy validation and fallback mechanisms

### 5. Event Handler Implementations

**Priority: Medium**

The `EventHandler` interface exists but no concrete implementations:

**Missing Components:**
- Timer event handlers
- Completion event handlers
- Error event handlers
- User interaction event handlers

### 6. Result Span Management

**Priority: Low**

`IResultSpanBuilder` interface exists but no implementation:

**Missing Components:**
- Concrete `ResultSpanBuilder` class
- Timing integration
- Span lifecycle management
- Result aggregation

## Integration Issues

### 1. Type Mismatches

Several interfaces don't align correctly:

```typescript
// JitCompiler expects RuntimeScript but gets WodScript
constructor(script: RuntimeScript) // JitCompiler
constructor(public readonly script: WodScript) // ScriptRuntime
```

### 2. Missing Dependencies

`JitCompiler` constructor expects dependencies that aren't provided:

```typescript
constructor(script: RuntimeScript, fragmentCompiler: FragmentCompilationManager, strategyManager: IRuntimeJitStrategies)
```

But `ScriptRuntime` only passes the script:

```typescript
this.jit = new JitCompiler(script);
```

### 3. Interface Evolution

Some interfaces have evolved beyond their current implementations:

- `EventHandler` interface changed but block implementations haven't been updated
- `IRuntimeAction` interface needs concrete implementation
- `tick()` method return types inconsistent across implementations

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)

1. **Fix JitCompiler Constructor and Dependencies**
   - Align constructor parameters with actual usage
   - Implement proper dependency injection
   - Create default implementations for missing dependencies

2. **Complete Fragment Compilation System**
   - Implement basic fragment compilers for each type
   - Create fragment compiler registry
   - Add basic compilation logic

3. **Fix Action System Foundation**
   - Define concrete `IRuntimeAction` implementations
   - Fix event handler interface usage
   - Implement basic action execution

### Phase 2: Block Compilation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Complete JitCompiler Methods**
   - Implement `idle()` and `end()` methods
   - Complete compilation pipeline
   - Add error handling and validation

2. **Enhance Strategy System**
   - Register default strategies
   - Implement strategy selection logic
   - Add fallback mechanisms

3. **Fix Integration Issues**
   - Align interface contracts
   - Fix type mismatches
   - Update deprecated method calls

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 week)

1. **Event Handler Implementations**
   - Create concrete event handlers
   - Implement event lifecycle
   - Add user interaction handling

   - Validate with Storybook scenarios

## Success Criteria

The ScriptRuntime will be considered complete when:

1. **Basic Compilation Works**: Simple workout scripts compile without errors
2. **Stack Management Functions**: Blocks can be pushed/popped correctly
3. **Event Processing Works**: Events flow through the system properly
4. **Strategy Selection Works**: Different block types are created based on content
5. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete workout execution from script to completion
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and edge cases

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Complex interdependencies between JitCompiler and FragmentCompilationManager
- Event handling system complexity
- Performance implications of JIT compilation

**Medium Risk:**
- Strategy pattern complexity
- Integration testing challenges

## Conclusion

The ScriptRuntime implementation has a solid foundation with core interfaces and basic structure in place. However, significant work remains to complete the system, particularly in the JitCompiler, fragment compilation, and event handling areas. With focused effort following the recommended implementation order, the system can be completed within 4-6 weeks.

The architecture is sound, and the existing codebase provides a good starting point. The main challenges will be ensuring proper integration between components and maintaining consistency across the evolving interfaces.
