# Metric Inheritance Implementation Complete

## Summary

We have successfully implemented the metric inheritance feature for the JIT Compiler as outlined in the [implementation plan](./metric-inheritance-implementation.md). This implementation enables parent blocks to influence the metrics of their children through composable inheritance rules.

## What We Built

### ✅ Core Infrastructure

1. **IMetricInheritance Interface** (`src/runtime/IMetricInheritance.ts`)
   - Defines the contract for metric inheritance logic
   - Single `compose(metric: RuntimeMetric): void` method

2. **MetricComposer Class** (`src/runtime/MetricComposer.ts`)
   - Orchestrates the application of inheritance rules
   - Maintains immutability of original metrics
   - Supports chaining multiple inheritance rules

3. **RuntimeMetric Types** (`src/runtime/RuntimeMetric.ts`)
   - Core data structures for compiled metrics
   - Includes `MetricValue` and `RuntimeMetric` interfaces

4. **Supporting Runtime Interfaces**
   - `IRuntimeBlock` - Updated with `inherit()` method
   - `ITimerRuntime` - Core runtime with stack management
   - `RuntimeStack` - Parent block hierarchy management
   - `EventHandler` - Event handling system
   - `ResultSpanBuilder` - Execution span management

### ✅ Example Implementations

1. **RoundsMetricInheritance** - Multiplies metrics by round count
2. **ProgressiveResistanceInheritance** - Adds progressive loading
3. **NullMetricInheritance** - No-op for blocks without inheritance

### ✅ JitCompiler Integration

Updated compilation pipeline:
1. Fragment Compilation (existing)
2. **Metric Inheritance** (new)
3. Block Creation (existing)

### ✅ Documentation and Examples

- [Implementation Status](./metric-inheritance-implementation-status.md)
- [Usage Examples](./metric-inheritance-usage-examples.md)
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Key Features

### 🔄 Composable Inheritance
```typescript
const inheritanceStack = [
  new RoundsMetricInheritance(3),
  new ProgressiveResistanceInheritance(10, 2)
];
const finalMetrics = composer.compose(inheritanceStack);
```

### 🛡️ Immutable Operations
Original metrics are never modified - only copies are transformed.

### 🧪 Testable Architecture
Each inheritance rule can be tested in isolation:
```typescript
test("should multiply reps by rounds", () => {
  const composer = new MetricComposer(baseMetrics);
  const result = composer.compose([new RoundsMetricInheritance(3)]);
  expect(result[0].values[0].value).toBe(30); // 10 * 3
});
```

### 🔌 Extensible Design
New inheritance patterns can be added without modifying existing code:
```typescript
class CustomInheritance implements IMetricInheritance {
  compose(metric: RuntimeMetric): void {
    // Custom logic here
  }
}
```

## Real-World Usage

### Simple Rounds Workout
```
3 Rounds
  10 Push-ups     → 30 total reps
  15 Squats       → 45 total reps
```

### Progressive Loading
```
4 Rounds (+10lbs each)
  5 Deadlifts @ 135lbs → Round 1: 135lbs, Round 2: 145lbs, etc.
```

### Nested Structures
```
3 Rounds
  2 Sets
    8 Pull-ups  → 8 * 2 * 3 = 48 total reps
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Inheritance logic is isolated
2. **Composability** - Multiple rules can be chained
3. **Testability** - Each component is independently testable  
4. **Extensibility** - New patterns are easy to add
5. **Performance** - Minimal overhead with efficient composition
6. **Maintainability** - Clear, focused responsibilities

## Next Steps

The core metric inheritance system is complete and ready for integration with the existing codebase. The next phase would involve:

1. **Integration with Block Strategies** - Update existing strategies to use composed metrics
2. **Concrete Block Implementations** - Implement `inherit()` methods in actual block classes
3. **Advanced Patterns** - Time-based, percentage-based, and context-aware inheritance
4. **Performance Optimization** - If needed based on real-world usage
