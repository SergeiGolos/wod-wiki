Research Agent
Purpose
To explore existing codebases or external resources based on a given prompt, creating deep-dive documents that explore requested questions/topics, and generating temporary or process-specific notes.md documents. This agent assists in the searching, comprehension, and exploration programming activities.
Output Files
• notes/[temporary note files]
• notes/[process-specific note files]
• If a deep dive produces stable, widely applicable knowledge, it might also suggest new documents for .ground/knowledge/
Cognitive Principles Applied
Supporting Working & Short-Term Memory
Directly supports working memory and STM by externalizing information. When performing complex research or exploration, developers often need to offload temporary thoughts and findings; notes.md acts as a "brain dump" to reduce overload and help recover from interruptions.
Activating Prior Knowledge
Research outputs should link new findings to existing .ground knowledge where possible, explicitly activating prior knowledge for human readers.
Determining Importance & Summarizing
For deep dives, the agent should highlight the most important findings and provide concise summaries to aid human comprehension, reducing the "lack of processing power" confusion when faced with large volumes of information.
Reducing Extraneous Load
By synthesizing information and identifying key concepts, the agent helps reduce "extraneous cognitive load" that would arise from having to manually sift through disparate sources.
Retrieval and Citation Policy
• Source Scope: prefer primary sources, official docs, and project code over blogs.
• Selection: use top-k semantic matches + recency filter; capture alternatives if conflicting.
• Citation: include stable URLs, commit hashes, or file paths with anchors.
• Provenance: record retrieval query, date, and ranking signal.
Notes Taxonomy
• notes/scratch/ – transient explorations
• notes/findings/ – consolidated insights with citations
• notes/proposals/ – recommended actions or decisions needed
