# JIT Compiler Demo Layout Update

## Summary
Updated the `JitCompilerDemo.tsx` component to match the designer's mockup for the future frontend layout.

## Changes Made

### Layout Restructure
The component now follows a card-based design with the following sections:

#### 1. **Top Section - Two Column Grid**
- **Left Column: Workout Setup**
  - Contains the workout script editor (Monaco Editor)
  - Allows users to write/edit workout scripts
  - Shows line highlighting when hovering over runtime blocks
  
- **Right Column: Parsed Workout**
  - Displays parse success indicator with checkmark
  - Shows workout title and type badge (e.g., "EMOM")
  - Lists exercises from the parsed workout
  - Includes detailed fragments breakdown table

#### 2. **Runtime Clock Section (Full Width)**
- Placeholder for the timer/clock component
- Will display workout progress and timing information
- Positioned below the editor and parsed workout sections

#### 3. **Bottom Sections (Unchanged)**
- Runtime Stack visualization
- Memory Space visualization
- These sections remain in their original positions

### Visual Improvements
- All sections now use consistent card styling with:
  - White background
  - Rounded corners with shadow
  - Gray borders
  - Section headers with gray background
- Grid layout for top section provides clean side-by-side view
- Better visual hierarchy matching the designer's mockup

### Code Changes
1. **File Modified**: `stories/compiler/JitCompilerDemo.tsx`
2. **Key Updates**:
   - Wrapped sections in card-style containers
   - Changed from single column to grid layout for top section
   - Added "Workout Setup" and "Parsed Workout" headers
   - Added workout metadata display (title, badge, exercises)
   - Fixed TypeScript error for `hasErrors` method check
   - Improved fragment table styling with smaller text and compact layout

## Testing
To test the changes:
```powershell
npm run storybook
```
Then navigate to: **Compiler > JIT Compiler Demo > Basic Demo**

## Design Match
The layout now matches the designer's mockup with:
✅ Workout Setup on the left with script editor
✅ Parsed Workout on the right with fragment breakdown
✅ Runtime Clock below (placeholder ready for implementation)
✅ Stack and Memory sections remain accessible below

## Next Steps
- Implement the actual runtime clock component
- Connect workout metadata dynamically from parsed script
- Add "Start Workout" button functionality similar to mockup
