Judge `{{filename}}` against "functions should do one thing": a function is
small (a few lines, one screen), its statements sit at a single level of
abstraction, and its name fully describes its single observable effect. If you
can extract a section or a second verb from it, it does more than one thing.

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.

Smells:
- `long_function` — Long Method: function body runs well past ~20-30 lines or one screen, so its steps can't be grasped at a glance.
- `flag_argument` — Flag Argument: boolean parameter whose value picks different branches inside the function body (`if (isDraft) ... else ...`).
- `hidden_side_effect` — Hidden Side Effect: function named as a query also mutates module/global state, a parameter, or performs I/O the name doesn't mention.
- `mixed_abstraction_levels` — Mixed Abstraction Levels (SLAP violation): high-level step calls sit between raw string slicing, index arithmetic, or formatting detail in the same body.
- `sectioned_function` — Sectioned Function: body divided by blank lines or comment banners (`// step 1`, `// now validate`) each naming a distinct task.
- `deep_nesting` — Deep Nesting / Arrow Code: 4+ indentation levels or a pyramid of `if`/`for`/`try` with the happy path buried mid-function.
- `command_query_mix` — Command-Query Mixing: one function both returns a value and changes state, so callers can't tell which it does.
- `and_named_function` — "And" Name: identifier like `loadAndSaveUser` naming two responsibilities in a single function.

Not violations: a single top-level try/finally wrapping a linear flow;
conventional accessors whose caching is invisible to callers.
