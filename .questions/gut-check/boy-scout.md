Judge `{{filename}}` against the Boy Scout Rule: leave the code better than you
found it. This is judged from the file's visible hygiene only — evidence of care
vs neglect readable in the artifact itself (no git history).

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.

Smells:
- `orphan_todo_markers` — Unfinished-Work Marker: TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments with no ticket, owner, or date, especially several or stale-looking ones.
- `commented_out_code` — Commented-Out Code: comments containing syntactically valid code (statements, function bodies, imports) instead of prose.
- `dead_code` — Dead Code: unreachable branches (`if (false)`, code after return), unused variables/functions/params left in place.
- `leftover_debug_logging` — Debug Debris: console.log/print/dbg!/dd calls, ad-hoc timers or dumps left on active paths.
- `copy_paste_debris` — Duplicated Code: near-identical blocks within the file differing only in a literal or name.
- `orphaned_imports` — Unused Import: requires/imports/usings referring to nothing used in the file.
- `style_seams` — Inconsistent Idiom: mixed indentation, quote style, naming convention, or error-handling pattern within one file, marking where un-scouted patches landed.

Not violations: a single dated/ticketed TODO is a legitimate way to defer work
(a warning at most); deliberate feature flags; intentional compatibility
shims.
