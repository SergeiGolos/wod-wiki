Judge `{{filename}}` against KISS: a file should contain only the complexity the
problem demands. Essential complexity (inherent to the problem) is fine;
accidental complexity (self-inflicted via tools, cleverness, or speculative
design) is the violation. The bar is not "short" but "nothing a reader must
decode that the problem didn't force".

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.
`rework` is true when accidental complexity outruns the problem.

Smells:
- `long_method` — Long Method: one function spans many lines / mixes several jobs and cannot be summarized in a single sentence.
- `deep_nesting` — Arrow Anti-Pattern: if/else/for/try blocks indented 4+ levels into an "arrow" shape instead of guard clauses or early returns.
- `needless_indirection` — Middle Man / Indirection Layer: pass-through wrappers, single-implementation interfaces, or factory chains that forward calls without adding behavior.
- `speculative_generality` — Speculative Generality: unused type parameters, config flags, extension points, or "just in case" flexibility serving no current requirement.
- `premature_optimization` — Premature Optimization: manual caching, bit tricks, unrolled loops, or hand-rolled fast paths with no measured need, sacrificing clarity.
- `obfuscated_cleverness` — Clever Code: chained ternaries, XOR swap, implicit coercion, or operator abuse a reader must mentally execute to decode.
- `long_parameter_list` — Long Parameter List: functions taking 5+ arguments (especially boolean flags) that an object or restructuring would collapse.
- `comment_deodorant` — Comment As Deodorant: comments like "hack", "don't touch", "works because..." apologizing for convoluted code instead of the code being clear.

Not violations: essential complexity the problem genuinely demands; measured
optimization of a demonstrated hot path.
