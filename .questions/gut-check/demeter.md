Judge `{{filename}}` against the Law of Demeter (principle of least knowledge): a
method should only invoke methods of itself, its fields, its parameters, and
objects it creates — "use only one dot". Reaching through `b` to reach `c`
couples the caller to `b`'s internal structure.

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.

Smells:
- `train_wreck` — Message Chains: an expression navigates 3+ dots through domain getters/actions, e.g. `a.getB().getC().doIt()`.
- `stranger_call` — Reaching Through: a method invokes a method on an object obtained by calling a getter on a parameter/field/local it didn't create.
- `repeated_navigation` — Duplicated Path: the same traversal (`x.getA().getB()...`) spelled out two or more times in the file.
- `null_guarded_chain` — Structural Dependence: a null/optional check or try/catch guards a mid-chain link, proving the caller knows the whole path's shape.
- `temp_hop_disguise` — Laundered Chain: the chain chopped into sequential temporaries, each used exactly once to fetch the next object — coupling unchanged, only cosmetically split.
- `feature_envy` — Envious Method: most of a method's statements operate on data pulled from another object's getters rather than its own state.
- `middle_man_bloat` — Over-Delegation: one-line pass-through methods dominating the class, forwarding to a single wrapped object just to dodge chains.

Not violations (chains that ARE the API): fluent builders/internal DSLs;
collection/array/map traversal; value-object transforms (`s.trim().upper()`);
freshly created objects; results only returned or passed as arguments.
