Judge `{{filename}}` against intention-revealing naming: every identifier —
variables, parameters, methods, classes, constants — must state what it
holds/does and why it exists, decodable from the file alone. A name that needs a
comment does not reveal its intent; misleading names skew every later read.

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.

Smells:
- `meaningless_name` — Meaningless Name: `data`, `temp`, `foo`, `result`, `value`, `handleStuff` standing in for a purpose-stating name.
- `misleading_name` — Misleading Name: identifier contradicts body behavior visible in the file, e.g. `getUsers()` that clears a collection, `isReady` returning a computed count, `userList` holding a Map.
- `type_prefix_encoding` — Systems Hungarian / Type Encoding: `strName`, `iCount`, `bFlag`, `dwFoo`, `mName`, `kName` prefixing compile-time type or scope that the declaration already shows.
- `noise_word_suffix` — Noise Word: `UserInfo`, `DataManager`, `OrderHelper`, `ResponseProcessor` appending Info/Data/Manager/Helper/Processor without distinguishing anything from the base concept.
- `unpronounceable_abbreviation` — Unpronounceable Abbreviation: drop-vowel or crunched names like `usrMgr`, `calcTot`, `prcItem`, `addrLst` that a reader cannot say aloud or grep reliably.
- `boolean_without_predicate` — Non-Predicate Boolean: a bool named `flag`, `check`, `state`, `status` — or negatively `isNotEnabled` forcing double negation — instead of an is/has/can/found-style predicate.
- `inconsistent_convention` — Inconsistent Convention In-File: one identifier category mixes styles (snake_case params among camelCase, UPPER locals, `fetch`/`get`/`retrieve` synonyms for one concept).
- `mental_mapping_name` — Mental-Mapping Name: single letters `a`, `b`, `x`, `o` outside tiny loop counters or one-char public-method parameters, making readers translate in their heads.

Not violations: well-known domain abbreviations the reader brings to the file
(SQL, URL); semantic prefixes distinguishing same-type different-meaning
values; conventional loop indices (`i`, `j`) in tiny scopes.
