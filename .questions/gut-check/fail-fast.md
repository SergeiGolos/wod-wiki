Judge `{{filename}}` against fail-fast error handling: when something goes
wrong, fail immediately and visibly instead of hiding it. Errors use exceptions
with context rather than null/-1/sentinel codes; boundary inputs are validated
so failures surface at the seam; caught exceptions are always visible — handled
knowingly, logged with context, or rethrown/wrapped.

Score each smell below 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) — the goal is a low score.

Smells:
- `empty_catch_block` — Empty Catch: catch block body is empty or only a comment, discarding the error entirely.
- `catch_log_continue` — Catch-Log-Continue: handler logs (or ignores) then falls through returning normally, so callers cannot distinguish success from failure.
- `null_return_signal` — Returning Null as Error: failure path returns null, pushing the real failure point to a later NPE/dereference.
- `sentinel_error_code` — Error-Code Return: method returns -1/0/false/status-code enum to flag failure instead of raising.
- `catch_all_catch` — Overly Broad Catch: bare `except:`/`catch (Exception)`/`catch (Throwable)` mid-stack, capturing programming errors it cannot handle.
- `deferred_validation` — Missing Boundary Checks: public entry point dereferences inputs with no precondition, letting bad values crash far from the boundary.
- `unasserted_impossible_state` — Unasserted Impossible State: branch marked "unreachable"/"should never happen" (comment or `default: pass`) with no assertion or throw.
- `lost_cause_chain` — Swallowed Cause: catch block logs/throws a new generic message without wrapping or recording the original exception.

Not violations: anticipated, expected failures handled gracefully at a defined
boundary (cache miss, optional config falling back to a documented default,
retry loop moving to the next item) — only hidden failures violate.
