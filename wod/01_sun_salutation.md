**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Duration:** 5-30 minutes (scalable)

## Overview

Sun Salutation, known in Sanskrit as Surya Namaskar, is a flowing sequence of 12 yoga postures performed in a continuous, rhythmic pattern. This practice represents one of the most fundamental and universally recommended sequences across both r/yoga and r/yogaflows communities. The sequence serves as a complete practice in itself, blending movement with breathwork (pranayama) to create a meditative yet physically energizing experience. Traditionally practiced at sunrise, Sun Salutations can be performed at any time of day and are particularly valued for their ability to warm up the entire body, synchronize breath with movement, and establish a meditative state of mind.

The practice consists of two main variations: Surya Namaskar A (the foundational sequence) and Surya Namaskar B (a more challenging variation that incorporates warrior poses). Each round consists of two sets—one leading with the right leg and one with the left—ensuring balanced development of the body. The Reddit yoga community consistently recommends this practice as an excellent standalone routine for busy days or as a warm-up for longer practices, with many practitioners noting that even five minutes of Sun Salutations followed by Savasana provides significant physical and mental benefits.

## The Practice

### Surya Namaskar A (Classical Sun Salutation)

**The 12-Pose Sequence:**

1. **Pranamasana (Prayer Pose)** — Stand at the front of your mat, feet together, palms pressed together at heart center. Establish steady breathing and set your intention for practice.

2. **Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose)** — Inhale as you sweep your arms up and slightly back, creating a gentle backbend. Keep your gaze upward and lengthen through the entire front body.

3. **Uttanasana (Standing Forward Fold)** — Exhale as you fold forward from the hips, bringing your hands to the floor beside your feet (bend knees as needed). Let your head hang heavy and relax your neck.

4. **Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Low Lunge)** — Inhale as you step your right foot back into a lunge, lowering the right knee to the floor. Keep your fingertips on the floor or blocks, gaze forward.

5. **Phalakasana (Plank Pose)** — Exhale as you step your left foot back to meet the right, creating a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and keep your wrists directly under your shoulders.

6. **Ashtanga Namaskara (Eight-Point Salutation)** — Lower your knees, chest, and chin to the floor while keeping your hips elevated. Eight points touch the floor: both feet, both knees, both hands, chest, and chin.

7. **Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)** — Inhale as you slide forward and lift your chest into Cobra. Keep your elbows close to your body and your shoulders away from your ears.

8. **Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog)** — Exhale as you press back and up into Downward Dog. Press your hands into the floor, lift your hips, and let your heels reach toward the floor. Hold for 5 breaths.

9. **Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Low Lunge)** — Inhale as you step your right foot forward between your hands, returning to a low lunge on the opposite side.

10. **Uttanasana (Standing Forward Fold)** — Exhale as you step your left foot forward to meet the right, folding into a standing forward bend.

11. **Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose)** — Inhale as you rise, sweeping your arms up and back into a gentle backbend.

12. **Pranamasana (Prayer Pose)** — Exhale as you return to the starting position with palms together at heart center.

**Complete the second set by stepping back with the left foot first.**

### Surya Namaskar B (Extended Sun Salutation)

Surya Namaskar B follows the same principles but adds Chair Pose and Warrior I to create a more challenging sequence that builds additional heat and strength:

1. **Utkatasana (Chair Pose)** — Begin standing, inhale and bend your knees, sinking your weight back as if sitting in a chair. Arms reach overhead.

2. **Uttanasana (Standing Forward Fold)** — Exhale, fold forward.

3. **Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Low Lunge)** — Inhale, step right foot back.

4. **Phalakasana (Plank Pose)** — Exhale, step left foot back.

5-8. **Same as Surya Namaskar A** (Eight-Point, Cobra, Downward Dog)

9. **Virabhadrasana I (Warrior I)** — From Downward Dog, step right foot forward, rise into Warrior I with arms overhead. Hold for 5 breaths.

10. Return through Plank sequence, then **Warrior I on the left side**.

11-12. **Complete as Surya Namaskar A** (Forward fold, Raised arms, Prayer pose)

## Proper Training Guidelines

### For Beginners

Start with 3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A at a slow pace, focusing on breath synchronization rather than depth of pose. Your primary goal during the first few weeks is to memorize the sequence and establish the breath-to-movement connection. Each movement should take approximately one breath—one inhale or one exhale per transition. Do not rush; the practice should feel fluid and meditative rather than rushed or mechanical.

Use modifications freely in the beginning: bend your knees in forward folds, lower your knees in plank if needed, and take Cobra instead of Upward Dog. Many practitioners find it helpful to practice in front of a mirror initially to check their alignment, or to use video guidance until the sequence becomes second nature. The Cleveland Clinic recommends focusing on form before speed, as poor alignment habits developed early can be difficult to correct later.

### Building Your Practice

Once you can complete 5 rounds of Surya Namaskar A comfortably, begin introducing Surya Namaskar B. A typical progression might be 3 rounds of A followed by 3 rounds of B, building gradually to the traditional Ashtanga practice of 5 A's and 3-5 B's before moving into standing poses. The Reddit community notes that this sequence alone, practiced consistently, can serve as a complete daily practice for those with limited time.

### Breath Work

The breath should be steady and even throughout. Inhale during upward movements and backbends; exhale during downward movements and forward folds. If you find yourself breathless, slow down or reduce the number of rounds. The practice should never feel frantic or gasping. Many practitioners use Ujjayi breath (victorious breath) to maintain focus and generate internal heat, though this is not required for beginners.

### Best Time to Practice

Traditionally, Sun Salutations are practiced at sunrise facing east, but they can be done at any time of day. Morning practice energizes the body for the day ahead, while evening practice can serve as a gentle way to transition from work. Some practitioners find a brief session beneficial before meditation, as the physical movement helps quiet the mind.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Rushing through poses:** Each breath should have a corresponding movement; don't skip the breath counting
- **Collapsing in Plank:** Maintain a straight line from head to heels; modify by lowering knees if needed
- **Forcing backbends:** Keep length in the spine rather than crunching the lower back
- **Holding breath:** If you can't breathe smoothly, the practice is too intense; reduce rounds or slow down
- **Skipping Savasana:** Always end with at least a few minutes of rest to integrate the practice
