# Threshold Pace Training Set

**Category**: Endurance/Speed  
**Type**: Intervals  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Description

Threshold pace training is the cornerstone of competitive swimming programs. This workout targets your "threshold pace" - the fastest speed you can maintain for an extended period (roughly your 400-800 pace). The r/swimming community values these sets for improving sustained speed and teaching the body to process lactate more efficiently.

## WOD Wiki Syntax

### Standard Threshold Set

```wod

## Breakdown

- **Rounds**: 8-15 x 100s (or equivalent distance)
- **Pace**: Threshold pace (sustainable for ~7-10 minutes continuous)
- **Rest**: Short (10-30 seconds)
- **Goal**: Maintain threshold pace with minimal degradation

## Collectible Metrics

- **Threshold Pace**: Your fastest sustainable 100 pace
- **Pace Consistency**: Difference between fastest and slowest rep
- **Heart Rate**: Should reach ~85-90% max by end of set
- **Perceived Exertion**: Should feel "comfortably hard"

## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "I'm having writer's block and could use some inspiration. I would love to know your favorite sets to help improve threshold pace!"

— Original question that sparked threshold discussions

> "A good rule of thumb is to have at least one of each: warmup, sprint set, endurance set, technique set, and cooldown. You can mix around the order."

— Workout composition guidance

> "Stretch your limits. Do more repeats in a set, do more sets, take shorter rests in intervals, increase your stroke rate, do negative splits."

— Advice on building endurance

> "If you're swimming 100s on 1:30 then the rest should only be around 10-15 seconds. If you can't maintain that, then decrease pace until you can."

— Interval and pace relationship

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Find Your Threshold**: Swim a 400 or 800 time trial; your average 100 pace is roughly your threshold
2. **Start Conservative**: It's better to finish strong than blow up early
3. **Use the Clock**: Track every rep; consistency is the goal
4. **Short Rest**: Threshold work requires short rest intervals (10-20 seconds)
5. **Build Gradually**: Start with fewer reps, add as fitness improves

## Proper Training Method

### Determining Your Threshold Pace

**Method 1: Time Trial**
- Swim a 400m (or 500 yard) freestyle at maximum effort
- Calculate your average 100 pace
- Example: 400m in 5:20 = 1:20 per 100 = threshold pace

**Method 2: Test Set**
- Swim 10 x 100 on an interval you can barely make
- Your average pace is approximately threshold
- Example: 10 x 100 on 1:30, averaging 1:18 = threshold ≈ 1:18-1:20

**Method 3: Heart Rate**
- Use a heart rate monitor
- Threshold pace occurs at ~85-90% of max heart rate
- Should feel "comfortably hard" - challenging but sustainable

### Warm-Up (Required)

Threshold training requires a thorough warm-up:

```wod
400m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Build
  :15 Rest
(4)
  25m Sprint @ 80%
  :30 Rest
```

The build and sprint elements prepare your energy systems for the main set.

### Main Set Execution

#### Classic Threshold Set

```wod
(10)
  100m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :20 Rest
```

Maintain consistent pace across all 10. Record each split.

#### Distance-Based Threshold

```wod
(5)
  200m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :30 Rest
```

Longer distances for endurance athletes.

#### Variable Distance Threshold

```wod
(3)
  200m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :30 Rest
(4)
  100m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :20 Rest
(4)
  50m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :15 Rest
```

Descending distances while maintaining pace.

#### Broken Distance

```wod
(3)
  + 150m Freestyle @ Threshold
  :10 Rest
  + 150m Freestyle @ Threshold
  1:00 Rest
```

Swim 300 broken into two 150s with short rest.

### Technique Under Fatigue

As the set progresses and fatigue sets in:

1. **Maintain Stroke Length**: Don't let strokes get short and choppy
2. **Keep Kicking**: The kick is often the first thing to fade
3. **Stay Relaxed**: Tension increases energy cost
4. **Focus on Form Cues**: High elbow, full extension, strong finish
5. **Control Breathing**: Maintain rhythm even when tired

### Progressive Overload

To progress threshold training:

1. **Add Reps**: Start at 6 x 100, build to 15 x 100
2. **Decrease Rest**: Start at 25 seconds, reduce to 10-15 seconds
3. **Increase Distance**: Move from 100s to 125s to 150s
4. **Improve Pace**: Lower your threshold pace by 1-2 seconds per 100
5. **Add Rounds**: Multiple threshold sets in one session

### Cool-Down (Required)

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
100m Backstroke
100m Choice
```

### Frequency Recommendation

- **Distance Swimmers**: 2-3 threshold sessions per week
- **Middle Distance**: 1-2 threshold sessions per week
- **Sprinters**: 1 threshold session per week (aerobic base)
- **Triathletes**: 1-2 threshold sessions per week

## Variations

### Negative Split Threshold

```wod
(10)
  100m Freestyle (second 50 faster than first)
  :20 Rest
```

Teaches pacing and finishing strong.

### Pace Change Set

```wod
(8)
  75m @ Threshold
  25m Sprint
  :20 Rest
```

Combines threshold with sprint work.

### Lactate Tolerance

```wod
(6)
  100m Freestyle @ Threshold -3 seconds
  :30 Rest
```

Slightly faster than threshold with longer rest.

### Time-Based Threshold

```wod
15:00 AMRAP
  100m Freestyle @ Threshold
```

As many 100s as possible in 15 minutes at threshold pace.

## Physiology Notes

**What is Threshold?**

Your lactate threshold (also called anaerobic threshold) is the exercise intensity at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood faster than it can be removed. Training at this intensity:

1. **Improves Lactate Clearance**: Your body becomes more efficient at processing lactate
2. **Raises the Threshold**: You can swim faster before lactate accumulates
3. **Builds Mitochondria**: Increased aerobic capacity at the cellular level
4. **Improves Economy**: Better fuel utilization during exercise

**Why Short Rest?**

The short rest intervals (10-20 seconds) are crucial:
- Maintains elevated heart rate throughout the set
- Creates cumulative lactate buildup
- Forces the body to adapt to processing lactate while working
- Simulates race conditions where there's no rest

**Signs You're at Threshold**:
- Breathing is hard but controlled
- Muscles burn but you can continue
- Can speak in short phrases but not full sentences
- Heart rate 85-90% of maximum

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting Too Fast**: First few reps should feel controlled, not easy
2. **Too Much Rest**: Long rest defeats the purpose of threshold training
3. **Inconsistent Pace**: All reps should be within 1-2 seconds
4. **Skipping Warm-Up**: Cold muscles can't process lactate efficiently
5. **Ignoring Form**: Maintain technique even when tired
