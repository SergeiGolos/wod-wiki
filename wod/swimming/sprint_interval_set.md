# Sprint Interval Set

**Category**: Speed/Power  
**Type**: Intervals  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Description

Sprint Interval Sets are essential for developing explosive power and speed in the water. The r/swimming community consistently recommends these high-intensity sets for swimmers looking to improve their sprint times. These workouts focus on maximum effort bursts with generous rest periods to allow for full recovery between efforts.

## WOD Wiki Syntax

### Basic Sprint Set

```wod
(10-15)
  25m Sprint Freestyle
  :35 Rest
```

### Advanced Sprint Set (50s)

```wod
(10)
  50m Sprint Freestyle
  2:30 Rest
```

### Maximum Sprint Set (100s)

```wod
(4)
  100m Sprint Freestyle
  6:00 Rest
```

## Breakdown

- **Rounds**: Varies by distance (more short sprints, fewer long sprints)
- **Work-to-Rest Ratio**: 1:3 to 1:6 (longer rest for longer distances)
- **Primary Stroke**: Freestyle (can be adapted to any stroke)
- **Goal**: Maximum effort on each repetition with complete recovery

## Collectible Metrics

- **Time per Rep**: Record each sprint time to track consistency
- **Pace per 100**: Calculate your sprint pace
- **Fatigue Index**: Compare first rep time to last rep time

## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "Try 25's on the minute, about 10-15 50's on the 2:30-3:00, or 100's sprint on the 6-7 minute intervals. Those are all classic sprint sets."

— [u/swimcoach](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/ken72w/sprint_sets/)

> "For sprint work, some high quality all out and broken swims of 25, 50, 75, and 100 distances. For example 4 x 100's on 6 minute interval. (High work, high effort...)"

— Community coach recommendation

> "Generally they suggest 5-10 sets of 10-30 sec sprints, as fast as you can manage. But making sure you recover fully in between each interval."

— Sprint training consensus

> "If you're swimming 100s on 1:30 then the rest should only be around 10-15 seconds. If you can't maintain that, then decrease pace until you can."

— Interval guidance for threshold sprints

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Full Recovery is Key**: Unlike endurance sets, sprint sets require complete recovery between reps. If you're still breathing hard, you haven't rested enough.

2. **Quality Over Quantity**: 4 perfect sprints are better than 15 mediocre ones. Stop when form breaks down.

3. **Track Your Times**: Sprint training is all about data. Record every rep to measure improvement.

4. **Use the Clock**: Don't estimate your rest. Use the pace clock to ensure consistent intervals.

## Proper Training Method

### Warm-Up (Required)

Sprint training requires a thorough warm-up to prevent injury and prepare the nervous system:

```wod
400m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Build
  :20 Rest
(4)
  25m Sprint @ 75%
  1:00 Rest
```

### Main Set Execution

#### 25-Meter Sprints (Beginner/Intermediate)

```wod
(12)
  25m Sprint Freestyle
  :40 Rest
```

- Focus on explosive start and breakout
- Maintain maximum effort for entire 25m
- Rest should feel "too long" - that's correct

#### 50-Meter Sprints (Intermediate/Advanced)

```wod
(8)
  50m Sprint Freestyle
  2:30 Rest
```

- Focus on maintaining speed through the second half
- Practice turn speed and breakout
- Goal: No more than 2-3 seconds drop-off from first to last rep

#### 100-Meter Sprints (Advanced)

```wod
(4)
  100m Sprint Freestyle
  6:00 Rest
```

- This is race-pace simulation
- First 50 should be controlled sprint, second 50 is all-out
- Use race strategy: breathe pattern, turn timing

### Technique Focus Points

1. **Start/Push-off**: Explosive wall push with tight streamline
2. **Breakout**: Strong first stroke, maintain momentum from push
3. **Stroke Rate**: Higher turnover than distance swimming
4. **Kick**: 6-beat kick throughout; this is not the time to save legs
5. **Breathing**: Every 2-4 strokes maximum; some swimmers breathe less

### Cool-Down (Required)

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
100m Backstroke
100m Choice
```

### Progressive Overload

To progress sprint training:

1. **Increase Speed**: Track times and aim to beat your best
2. **Decrease Rest**: Gradually reduce rest by 5-10 seconds (but never below 1:2 work:rest)
3. **Add Reps**: Only add reps when you can maintain pace across all existing reps
4. **Add Resistance**: Use parachutes or towers for overload

### Frequency Recommendation

- **In-Season**: 1-2 times per week
- **Off-Season**: 2-3 times per week
- **Taper**: Reduce volume, maintain intensity

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Insufficient Rest**: Sprinting without full recovery trains the wrong energy system
- **Starting Cold**: Always warm up thoroughly before sprinting
- **Poor Technique Under Fatigue**: Stop when form breaks down
- **Ignoring Starts and Turns**: These are where races are won

## Variations

### Stroke-Specific Sprints

```wod
(8)
  25m Sprint Butterfly
  :45 Rest
```

Adapt to backstroke, breaststroke, or butterfly. Adjust rest as needed.

### Broken Swims (Race Simulation)

```wod
(4)
  + 50m Sprint Freestyle
  :15 Rest
  + 50m Sprint Freestyle
  5:00 Rest
```

Simulates a broken 100 with short rest between 50s.

### Ladder Sprints

```wod
(25-50-75-100-75-50-25)
  Sprint Freestyle
  ? Rest
```

Rest 30 seconds per 25 meters swum.

### Pace Clock Sprints (Team Favorite)

```wod
(10)
  25m Sprint Freestyle
  1:00 EMOM
```

Start every minute on the minute. Rest is whatever time remains after your swim.

## Physiology Notes

Sprint training targets the **anaerobic alactic and lactic energy systems**:

- **Alactic (0-10 seconds)**: Pure power, ATP-PCr system
- **Lactic (10-60+ seconds)**: Glycolytic system, produces lactate

The generous rest periods allow:
- ATP-PCr replenishment (2-5 minutes for full recovery)
- Lactate clearance from muscles
- Neural recovery for maximum motor unit recruitment

This is why "feeling fresh" before each rep is essential - you're training the nervous system, not just the muscles.
