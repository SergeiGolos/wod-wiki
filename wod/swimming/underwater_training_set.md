# Underwater Training Set

**Category**: Breath Control/Specialized  
**Type**: Intervals  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  

## Description

Underwater training sets are popular among competitive swimmers looking to improve their breath-holding capacity, streamline efficiency, and overall underwater performance. This challenging workout, frequently cited in r/swimming, involves swimming underwater for one length of the pool followed by recovery freestyle swimming back.

**⚠️ WARNING**: Underwater swimming carries significant risks including shallow water blackout. Never practice alone. Always have a trained spotter present.

## WOD Wiki Syntax

### Standard Underwater Set

```wod
(10)
  25m Underwater
  25m Recovery Freestyle
```

### With Max Distance Test

```wod
(10)
  25m Underwater
  25m Recovery Freestyle
?m Max Underwater Test
```

## Breakdown

- **Rounds**: 10 repetitions (adjust based on ability)
- **Underwater Distance**: 25 yards/meters (one pool length)
- **Recovery**: Easy freestyle swim back
- **Primary Focus**: Breath control, streamline, dolphin kick efficiency
- **Goal**: Complete all underwater lengths without surfacing

## Collectible Metrics

- **Successful Reps**: Count of completed underwater lengths
- **Max Distance**: Longest underwater distance achieved in test
- **Recovery Time**: How quickly heart rate returns to normal between reps

## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "My favorite is 10X50s underwater down and recovery freestyle back and then a max distance underwater test after full recovery after the 10."

— Community favorite from workout discussion

> "This is a great set for improving your underwater dolphin kick. The key is to stay relaxed and not rush."

— Training advice from competitive swimmers

> "I started with just 4-5 reps and built up. Don't try to do all 10 on your first attempt."

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Never Practice Alone**: Shallow water blackout is a real risk. Always have a spotter.
2. **Stay Relaxed**: Tension increases oxygen consumption
3. **Start Small**: Begin with fewer reps and build up
4. **Quality Streamline**: This is as much about technique as breath-holding
5. **Hyperventilation Warning**: Do NOT hyperventilate before underwater swimming

## Proper Training Method

### Safety First

**CRITICAL SAFETY GUIDELINES**:

1. **Always have a spotter** who knows CPR and can recognize signs of distress
2. **Never hyperventilate** before underwater swimming - this suppresses the urge to breathe without increasing oxygen
3. **Know your limits** - stop if you feel dizzy, see stars, or experience any unusual sensations
4. **Surface immediately** if you feel any urge to breathe that you cannot comfortably suppress
5. **Do not push to failure** - leave a margin of safety on every rep

### Warm-Up (Required)

```wod
300m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Drill/Swim
  :20 Rest
100m Streamline Dolphin Kick
(4)
  15m Underwater @ 75%
  :30 Rest
```

### Main Set Execution

#### Phase 1: Technique Focus

```wod
(4)
  15m Underwater (tight streamline, strong kick)
  35m Recovery Swim
:30 Rest between reps
```

Focus on perfect streamline and efficient dolphin kick before attempting full lengths.

#### Phase 2: Building Distance

```wod
(6)
  20-25m Underwater (progress each rep)
  Recovery Swim Back
:30 Rest between reps
```

Gradually increase distance as comfort improves.

#### Phase 3: Full Set

```wod
(10)
  25m Underwater
  25m Recovery Freestyle
:15 Rest between reps
```

Rest briefly at the wall before each underwater attempt.

### Technique Focus Points

1. **Streamline Position**:
   - Arms extended overhead, biceps behind ears
   - Hands stacked, thumb locked on top
   - Core tight, body in straight line

2. **Dolphin Kick**:
   - Initiate from hips, not knees
   - Small, fast kicks are more efficient than large, slow ones
   - Kick both up AND down with equal power
   - Maintain knee bend of approximately 90 degrees at maximum flexion

3. **Body Position**:
   - Stay horizontal - avoid diving deep or surfacing
   - Keep head neutral, looking down
   - Engage core to prevent body wiggle

4. **Breath Control**:
   - Take one deep breath, then exhale slowly and steadily
   - Do not hold breath with closed glottis - this increases pressure
   - Relax mentally - anxiety increases oxygen consumption

### Progressive Overload

1. **Increase Reps**: Start at 4, build to 10
2. **Increase Distance**: Start at 15m, build to 25m
3. **Decrease Rest**: Reduce rest between reps from 30s to 15s
4. **Add Speed**: Increase kick tempo for faster underwater travel

### Cool-Down (Required)

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
100m Backstroke
50m Easy Kick
```

### Frequency Recommendation

- **In-Season**: Once per week maximum
- **Off-Season**: 1-2 times per week
- **Pre-Competition**: Reduce or eliminate during taper

## Variations

### Bimanual Underwater (Advanced)

```wod
(6)
  25m Underwater (arms at sides)
  25m Recovery Freestyle
```

More challenging due to reduced streamline. Requires stronger kick.

### Vertical Underwater Kicking

```wod
(4)
  30s Vertical Dolphin Kick (hands out of water)
  30s Rest
```

Builds leg strength and endurance for underwater work.

### 15-Meter Sprint Focus

```wod
(8)
  15m Maximum Speed Underwater
  35m Recovery Freestyle
:45 Rest
```

Focus on explosive speed off the wall, simulating race breakouts.

### Distance Progression

```wod
(15-20-25-20-15)
  Underwater
  Recovery Swim
```

## Physiology Notes

Underwater swimming relies on:

- **Oxygen Storage**: Lungs hold approximately 6 liters of air when full
- **Oxygen Consumption**: At rest, ~250ml O2/minute; during exercise, can exceed 3L/minute
- **Carbon Dioxide Tolerance**: The urge to breathe is triggered by CO2 buildup, not O2 depletion
- **Mammalian Dive Reflex**: Heart rate decreases underwater, blood shunts to vital organs

**Why Hyperventilation is Dangerous**: Hyperventilation reduces CO2 levels without significantly increasing O2. This delays the urge to breathe while O2 levels continue to fall, increasing risk of blackout before feeling the need to surface.

## Disclaimer

This workout involves breath-holding and underwater swimming, which carry risks of shallow water blackout and drowning. Always:
- Practice with a qualified spotter
- Follow all pool safety rules
- Consult with a coach if you are new to underwater training
- Stop immediately if you experience any distress
