# Ashtanga Primary Series (Yoga Chikitsa)

**Category:** Traditional Yoga System  
**Type:** Fixed Sequence Vinyasa  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes (full series)

---

## Overview

The Ashtanga Primary Series, known in Sanskrit as Yoga Chikitsa (Yoga Therapy), represents one of the most structured and comprehensive yoga practices available. This fixed sequence, developed by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, consists of a precise order of postures linked through vinyasa (breath-synchronized movement). The r/yoga community consistently recommends Ashtanga for practitioners seeking a systematic approach that builds progressively over time, with many noting that the series can be practiced daily and modified based on individual needs and abilities.

Unlike many yoga styles where sequences vary from class to class, Ashtanga follows the same series of postures in the same order every time. This repetition allows practitioners to focus inward rather than wondering what comes next, transforming the physical practice into a moving meditation. The Primary Series specifically targets detoxification and alignment, working systematically through the body to build strength, flexibility, and internal heat. Reddit users frequently mention that even practicing portions of the series provides substantial benefits, making it accessible to those who cannot commit to the full 90-minute practice.

## Proper Training Guidelines

### For Beginners

The traditional Ashtanga method involves learning the series pose by pose, adding new postures only when your teacher determines you are ready. For home practitioners without access to a Mysore-style teacher, begin with just the Sun Salutations for several weeks until they feel natural. The r/yoga community emphasizes starting slowly: "Begin with sun salutations. Once your practice is comfortable at 5 A and 5 B a day, you can start adding standing poses one at a time."

The standing sequence can take several months to learn properly. Focus on alignment over depth, using props and modifications as needed. Many poses have preparatory versions—for example, half-bound variations when full binds are not yet accessible. Remember that the practice is meant to be progressive; rushing into advanced poses before the body is ready can lead to injury.

### The Mysore Method

Traditional Ashtanga is taught in the Mysore style, where students practice at their own pace while teachers provide individual adjustments and instruction. In this format, you memorize the sequence gradually and practice only the poses you've been given. When you demonstrate proficiency, your teacher adds the next pose. This method allows for personalized progression and ensures that each student works at an appropriate level.

### Breath and Bandhas

Three key elements define Ashtanga practice:

1. **Ujjayi Breath:** Victorious breath with sound created by slightly constricting the throat. This breath generates heat and maintains focus throughout practice.

2. **Mula Bandha:** Root lock, engaging the pelvic floor muscles. This creates stability and energy lift throughout the body.

3. **Uddiyana Bandha:** Abdominal lock, drawing the lower belly in and up. This supports the lower back and creates lightness in movement.

### Vinyasa Count

Each pose has a traditional vinyasa count—the number of breaths and movements to enter and exit the pose. Learning this count transforms the practice into a precise moving meditation. The standard holds are 5 breaths per pose, though some finishing poses are held longer.

### Daily Practice (Six Days Per Week)

Traditional Ashtanga is practiced six days per week, with rest on moon days (new and full moons) and for ladies' holidays. However, many practitioners modify this schedule based on life circumstances. The practice can be shortened on busy days—doing Sun Salutations and finishing poses only—or modified for energy levels. Consistency matters more than perfection.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Skipping warm-ups:** Always do full Sun Salutations before proceeding
- **Forcing flexibility:** The practice builds flexibility over years, not weeks
- **Neglecting vinyasas:** The transitions between poses are as important as the poses themselves
- **Skipping finishing sequence:** Always include inversions and Savasana
- **Practice without rest days:** Recovery is essential for progress
