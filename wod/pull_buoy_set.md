# Pull Buoy Endurance Set

**Category**: Endurance/Strength  
**Type**: Intervals  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Description

Pull buoy sets are a staple of swimming training, allowing athletes to focus on upper body strength and technique while removing the lower body from the equation. The r/swimming community frequently recommends pull sets for developing upper body endurance, improving catch mechanics, and building the specific strength needed for distance swimming.

## WOD Wiki Syntax

### Standard Pull Set

```wod
(10)
  100m Freestyle Pull
  :20 Rest
```

### Distance Pull Set

```wod
(4)
  200m Freestyle Pull
  :30 Rest
```

### Progressive Pull Set

```wod
(400-300-200-100)
  Freestyle Pull
  :30 Rest
```

## Breakdown

- **Equipment Required**: Pull buoy (placed between thighs or ankles)
- **Optional Equipment**: Hand paddles, swim snorkel
- **Focus**: Upper body strength, catch technique, body rotation
- **Goal**: Maintain consistent pace with upper body only

## Collectible Metrics

- **Pace per 100**: Track your pull speed (typically slower than full stroke)
- **Stroke Count**: Lower is better - indicates efficiency
- **Arm Fatigue**: Rate perceived exertion for arms (1-10 scale)
- **Distance per Stroke**: Measure efficiency gains over time

## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "One of my favorites is a freestyle pull set with snorkels, paddles, and pull-buoy (parachute/other resistance too, if possible). I generally go for something like 10x100s or a ladder like 400-300-200-100."

— Community favorite from sets discussion

> "Pull sets are great for building upper body strength. I like to add paddles for overload, but be careful not to overdo it."

— Training advice from experienced swimmers

> "When I'm consistently doing weighted squats and lunges, I definitely notice a positive difference when swimming. Pull sets complement this well."

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Don't Kick**: The purpose is to isolate the upper body - any kicking defeats the purpose
2. **Use a Snorkel**: Removes the need to turn for air, lets you focus on catch and pull
3. **Paddle Progression**: Start without paddles, add small paddles, progress to larger
4. **Body Position**: Without the kick, you need to maintain good body position through core engagement
5. **Mix Positions**: Alternate buoy between thighs and ankles for different challenges

## Proper Training Method

### Equipment Guide

**Pull Buoy**:
- Standard placement: Between thighs
- Advanced placement: Between ankles (requires stronger core)
- Purpose: Floats legs, removes kick from propulsion

**Hand Paddles** (Optional):
- Small paddles (tyr catalina): Good for beginners, focus on technique
- Medium paddles: Standard training size
- Large paddles: Advanced only, risk of shoulder injury
- Purpose: Increases water resistance, builds strength

**Swim Snorkel** (Optional):
- Front-mounted training snorkel preferred
- Allows head to stay down
- Purpose: Focus on technique without breathing interruption

### Warm-Up (Required)

```wod
300m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Drill/Swim
  :15 Rest
```

Light warm-up before adding equipment.

### Main Set Execution

#### Beginner Pull Set

```wod
(6)
  100m Freestyle Pull (buoy between thighs)
  :20 Rest
```

Focus on maintaining body position and smooth stroke technique.

#### Intermediate Pull Set

```wod
(8)
  100m Freestyle Pull (buoy + paddles)
  :15 Rest
```

Add paddles for increased resistance. Maintain consistent pace.

#### Advanced Pull Set

```wod
(10)
  100m Freestyle Pull (buoy + paddles + snorkel)
  :10 Rest
```

Full equipment set with minimal rest. Focus on technique under fatigue.

#### Distance Pull

```wod
(4)
  200m Freestyle Pull
  :30 Rest
```

Longer distances for endurance focus.

### Technique Focus Points

1. **Catch Phase**:
   - High elbow position as hand enters water
   - Fingertips point down, palm facing back
   - "Anchor" your hand before pulling back

2. **Pull Phase**:
   - Keep elbow high throughout pull
   - Hand accelerates through the water
   - Pull past your hip before recovery

3. **Body Rotation**:
   - Rotate approximately 45 degrees to each side
   - Rotation should come from hips, not shoulders
   - Maintain rotation even with pull buoy

4. **Core Engagement**:
   - Engage core to keep body horizontal
   - Without kick, you must use core to prevent legs from sinking
   - This is excellent core training

5. **Recovery**:
   - High elbow recovery
   - Relax arm during recovery phase
   - Enter water cleanly at shoulder width

### Progressive Overload

1. **Add Distance**: Progress from 100s to 200s to 400s
2. **Add Equipment**: Paddles, then snorkel, then resistance parachute
3. **Decrease Rest**: Reduce rest intervals from 20s to 10s to 5s
4. **Buoy Position**: Move buoy from thighs to ankles for core challenge
5. **Add Rounds**: Increase number of repetitions

### Cool-Down (Required)

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
100m Kick
```

Always follow pull sets with kick to balance the work.

### Frequency Recommendation

- **General Training**: 1-2 times per week
- **Distance Specialists**: 2-3 times per week
- **Sprint Specialists**: Once per week (strength maintenance)
- **Recovery Weeks**: Reduce or eliminate pull sets

## Variations

### Descending Pull Set

```wod
(400-300-200-100)
  Freestyle Pull
  :30 Rest
```

Ladder format with decreasing distances.

### Stroke Pull Set

```wod
(4)
  100m Backstroke Pull
  :20 Rest
(4)
  100m Breaststroke Pull
  :20 Rest
```

Pull sets for strokes other than freestyle. Use appropriate technique modifications.

### Resistance Pull

```wod
(8)
  100m Freestyle Pull (with parachute)
  :30 Rest
```

Adds significant resistance. Use longer rest intervals.

### Negative Split Pull

```wod
(6)
  100m Freestyle Pull (second 50 faster than first)
  :15 Rest
```

Focus on pacing and finishing strong.

### Paddle-Only Set

```wod
(4)
  50m Paddles Only (no buoy)
  :30 Rest
```

Builds grip strength and feel for the water.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sinking Legs**: Use core to keep legs up, not a scissor kick
2. **Cross-Over Entry**: Enter hands at shoulder width, not across center line
3. **Dropping Elbow**: Maintain high elbow throughout catch and pull
4. **Overreaching**: Don't over-extend on entry; this causes shoulder stress
5. **Ignoring Rest**: Pull sets are demanding; respect rest intervals
6. **Paddle Size Too Large**: Large paddles can cause shoulder injury; start small

## Physiology Notes

Pull sets target specific muscle groups:

- **Latissimus Dorsi**: Primary pulling muscle
- **Teres Major and Minor**: Assist in pull and rotation
- **Rhomboids**: Scapular retraction during pull
- **Rear Deltoids**: Arm extension and recovery
- **Core Muscles**: Maintain body position without kick

**Training Effect**: Pull sets build muscular endurance in the upper body, improving your ability to maintain stroke technique over long distances. This is especially valuable for distance swimmers and triathletes.
