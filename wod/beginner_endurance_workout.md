## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "Kickboard is good. Try to do a 100 freestyle and then take a rest. Then try to do 50 (usually one length of the pool is 25 yards or meters) with a kickboard, rest, and build from there."

— Beginner advice from experienced swimmers

> "Workout structure: Usually a 200 of a mix of swim and kick with a kickboard to warm-up. Then I suggest drills for 400-500yds/m. This is the core of the workout."

— Structured approach recommendation

> "It's usually something like: 300 free warmup, 4x50 of drill/swim, another 200 of a different warmup variant, and then a main set followed by a cool down."

— Training plan structure

> "A good rule of thumb is to have at least one of each: warmup, sprint set, endurance set, technique set, and cooldown."

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to swim 2000 yards on day one
2. **Focus on Form**: Good technique is more important than distance
3. **Use Equipment**: Kickboards and pull buoys help break up the work
4. **Be Consistent**: 3 times per week is better than one long session
5. **Listen to Your Body**: Rest when needed, progress gradually

Total: 1000m
```

Focus: Maintain pace or get faster through the set.

### Technique Focus Points

For beginners, prioritize these fundamental elements:

1. **Body Position**:
   - Eyes look down, not forward
   - Hips should be high (legs shouldn't drag)
   - Head position determines body position

2. **Breathing**:
   - Breathe to the side, not forward
   - One goggle in water, one out
   - Don't lift head to breathe

3. **Arm Stroke**:
   - Hand enters at shoulder width
   - Pull straight back (not across body)
   - Complete the stroke past your hip

4. **Kick**:
   - Kick from hips, not knees
   - Ankles should be loose and flexible
   - Small, fast kicks are better than large, slow ones

5. **Timing**:
   - Breathe as your body rotates
   - Don't pause your stroke to breathe
   - Continuous arm movement

### Warm-Up Routine

Always begin with a warm-up:

```wod
100m Freestyle Easy
50m Kick (with board)
50m Backstroke
```

This prepares your body and mind for the main set.

### Cool-Down Routine

Always end with a cool-down:

```wod
100m Freestyle Easy
50m Backstroke
50m Choice
```

This helps heart rate return to normal and prevents stiffness.

### Progressive Overload

Follow these principles for continued improvement:

1. **Add Distance**: Increase total yardage by 10-15% per week
2. **Decrease Rest**: Gradually reduce rest intervals
3. **Improve Pace**: Track times and aim for slight improvement
4. **Add Sessions**: Move from 2 to 3 to 4 sessions per week
5. **Add Variety**: Include kick sets, pull sets, and drills

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Going Too Fast**: Most beginners swim too fast and tire quickly
- **Skipping Warm-Up**: Cold muscles don't perform well
- **Holding Breath**: Exhale underwater continuously
- **Looking Forward**: Keep eyes down for proper body position
- **Progressing Too Quickly**: Increase volume gradually to avoid injury

### Frequency Recommendation

- **Minimum**: 2 sessions per week for maintenance
- **Recommended**: 3 sessions per week for improvement
- **Optimal**: 3-4 sessions per week for steady progress
- **Rest**: Include at least one rest day between sessions

## Training Philosophy

The beginner phase focuses on:

1. **Building the Habit**: Consistent attendance is more important than intensity
2. **Developing Technique**: Good habits now prevent bad habits later
3. **Cardiovascular Base**: Aerobic fitness that supports all future training
4. **Muscular Endurance**: Getting swimming-specific muscles in shape
5. **Mental Comfort**: Becoming confident and relaxed in the water

Remember: Every experienced swimmer started as a beginner. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small improvements.
