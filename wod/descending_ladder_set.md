## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "My favorite set is 500-400-300-200-100, all on a 1:30 interval. That's 1500 yards (plus your choice of a warm up and cool down)."

> "The ladder is great because you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The 500 feels long, but knowing each subsequent swim gets shorter helps mentally."

— Community consensus from favorite sets discussion

> "I adjust the interval based on my current fitness. Started at 1:45/100 when returning to swimming, now I can hold 1:30/100 for the whole set."

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Interval Selection**: Choose an interval that gives you 10-15 seconds rest on the 500; the rest naturally increases as distances decrease
2. **Negative Splits**: Try to swim the second half of each distance faster than the first
3. **Stroke Variation**: Advanced swimmers can alternate strokes (e.g., 500 free, 400 IM, 300 back, 200 breast, 100 sprint free)

## Proper Training Method

### Warm-Up (Recommended)

Before attempting this set, complete a proper warm-up:

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Drill/Swim
  :15 Rest
100m Kick
```

### Main Set Execution

1. **Pacing Strategy**: Start the 500 at a controlled, sustainable pace. Many swimmers make the mistake of going too hard early and fading on the shorter distances.

2. **Interval Management**: 
   - Beginner: 1:45-2:00 per 100 yards
   - Intermediate: 1:30-1:45 per 100 yards
   - Advanced: 1:15-1:30 per 100 yards

3. **Mental Approach**: Focus on one swim at a time. Don't think about the 500 during the 100, or vice versa.

4. **Stroke Technique**: As fatigue sets in, prioritize:
   - High elbow catch
   - Strong kick rhythm
   - Bilateral breathing for balance

### Cool-Down (Recommended)

```wod
200m Choice Easy
100m Backstroke Relax
```

### Progressive Overload

To progress this workout:

1. **Decrease Interval**: Start at 1:45/100, work down to 1:15/100
2. **Add Rounds**: Include 600 at the start for a 2000-yard set
3. **Increase Intensity**: Sprint the 100 at the end
4. **Add Equipment**: Use pull buoy for the longer distances

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Starting too fast**: The 500 should feel controlled, not maximum effort
- **Skipping warm-up**: Cold muscles lead to poor technique and injury risk
- **Inconsistent intervals**: Don't change the interval mid-set; adjust for next time
- **Poor turns**: Use this set to practice flip turns under fatigue

### Frequency Recommendation

- **Maintenance**: Once per week
- **Building Endurance**: 2-3 times per week with 48-hour rest between
- **Pre-Competition**: Taper to once per week, focusing on pace precision

## Variations

### Reverse Ladder (Ascending)

```wod
(100-200-300-400-500) Freestyle
```

Builds confidence and allows for warm-up into longer distances. Better for beginners.

### Double Ladder

```wod
(500-400-300-200-100)
  Freestyle
(100-200-300-400-500)
  Freestyle
```

Advanced variation totaling 3000 yards. Requires significant endurance base.

### Stroke-Specific Ladder

```wod
(500-400-300-200-100)
  IM Order
```

Excellent for IM swimmers; each distance focuses on a different stroke.
