# Individual Medley (IM) Training Set

**Category**: Technique/Endurance  
**Type**: Intervals  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Description

Individual Medley (IM) training sets are essential for developing versatility across all four competitive strokes. The r/swimming community particularly favors "Rolling IMs" - a creative set format where swimmers transition smoothly between strokes in a continuous flow. This workout builds stroke proficiency, transitions, and overall conditioning.

## WOD Wiki Syntax

### Rolling IMs (Community Favorite)

```wod
(6)
  + 75m Rolling IM
  :15 Rest
```

### Standard IM Set

```wod
(4)
  100m IM
  2:00 Rest
```

### Broken IM (Race Simulation)

```wod

  + 50m Butterfly
  + 25m Backstroke
  + 25m Breaststroke
  3:00 Rest
```

## Breakdown

- **Rounds**: 4-6 (depending on distance and ability)
- **Distances**: 75m, 100m, or 200m per round
- **Strokes**: Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Freestyle (in IM order)
- **Goal**: Smooth transitions between strokes, consistent pacing

## Collectible Metrics

- **Total Time**: Time for each IM repetition
- **Stroke Count**: Count strokes per length to measure efficiency
- **Transition Quality**: Rate the smoothness of each transition (1-5 scale)
- **Split Times**: Record times for each stroke segment

## Community Comments

### From r/Swimming Users:

> "Rolling IMs! These are done on the 75, where the last stroke becomes the first stroke of the next 75. We usually do them as 4/6 X 75."

— Community favorite from IM set discussion

> "Set intervals as needed. Great for working on transitions and stroke technique under fatigue."

— Coaching advice on Rolling IMs

> "I like to do 100s IM where you break them down: 25 fly, 25 back, 25 breast, 25 free. Focus on the transitions being smooth."

— Standard IM training recommendation

### Rolling IMs Explained:

The concept is to swim 75-yard/meter segments where the strokes "roll" into each other:

1. **Round 1**: 25 Fly + 25 Back + 25 Breast
2. **Round 2**: 25 Back + 25 Breast + 25 Free
3. **Round 3**: 25 Breast + 25 Free + 25 Fly
4. **Round 4**: 25 Free + 25 Fly + 25 Back
5. Continue cycling through...

This format ensures each stroke is practiced in different positions (first, middle, last) and emphasizes smooth transitions.

### Tips from the Community:

1. **Practice Transitions**: The turn between strokes is where races are won or lost
2. **Know Your Weakest Stroke**: IM exposes your weaknesses - use it to identify what to improve
3. **Pacing is Key**: Don't sprint the fly; save energy for breaststroke
4. **Streamline Every Turn**: Even between strokes, maintain tight streamlines

## Proper Training Method

### Warm-Up (Required)

IM training requires warming up all four strokes:

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
(4)
  50m Choice Stroke
  :20 Rest
(4)
  25m Each Stroke (Fly, Back, Breast, Free)
  :15 Rest
```

### Main Set Execution

#### Rolling IMs (Recommended)

```wod
(6)
  + 75m Rolling IM
  :15 Rest
```

**Rotation Pattern**:
1. Fly-Back-Breast
2. Back-Breast-Free
3. Breast-Free-Fly
4. Free-Fly-Back
5. Fly-Back-Breast
6. Back-Breast-Free

Rest 15-20 seconds between 75s. Complete rest interval on the wall.

#### Standard 100 IMs

```wod
(4)
  100m IM (Fly-Back-Breast-Free)
  2:00 Rest
```

Focus on executing proper stroke order and legal transitions.

#### 200 IM Breakdown

```wod
(2)
  + 50m Butterfly
  + 50m Backstroke
  + 50m Breaststroke
  + 50m Freestyle
  3:00 Rest
```

Full 200 IM with generous rest for race simulation.

### Transition Technique

**Fly to Back**:
1. Touch with two hands simultaneously
2. Push off on back
3. Begin dolphin kicks underwater
4. Breakout into backstroke

**Back to Breast**:
1. Touch wall on back (one hand is legal, two hands often preferred for technique)
2. Flip turn or open turn (flip is faster but requires practice)
3. Push off into breaststroke pullout
4. Begin breaststroke swimming

**Breast to Free**:
1. Touch with two hands simultaneously
2. Open turn with quick pivot
3. Push off into freestyle
4. Begin flutter kicking underwater

### Stroke-Specific Cues

**Butterfly**:
- Low recovery, enter at shoulder width
- Two kicks per stroke cycle
- Breathe every stroke or every other stroke (depending on training phase)
- Don't over-kick; save legs for later strokes

**Backstroke**:
- Consistent kick throughout
- Rotate hips with each stroke
- Hand entry at 11 and 1 o'clock positions
- Keep head neutral

**Breaststroke**:
- Powerful outsweep and insweep
- Snap kick with feet turned out
- Glide between strokes
- This is the slowest stroke - don't rush it

**Freestyle**:
- Strong, consistent kick
- High elbow catch
- Bilateral breathing recommended in training
- This is your recovery and sprint stroke - push the pace

### Progressive Overload

1. **Increase Distance**: Move from 75s to 100s to 150s to 200s
2. **Decrease Rest**: Reduce rest intervals gradually
3. **Add Reps**: Start at 4 rounds, build to 8
4. **Target Times**: Set goal times for each distance based on race pace

### Cool-Down (Required)

```wod
200m Freestyle Easy
100m Choice Stroke Easy
100m Kick
```

### Frequency Recommendation

- **IM Specialists**: 3-4 times per week
- **General Fitness**: 1-2 times per week
- **Single-Stroke Specialists**: Once per week for variety

## Variations

### Stroke Order Variations

```wod

  100m Reverse IM (Free-Breast-Back-Fly)
```

Reverse order increases difficulty, especially the fly finish.

### Distance IM

For endurance athletes and IM specialists.

### Broken 400 IM

```wod
(4)
  + 100m Butterfly
  + 100m Backstroke
  + 100m Breaststroke
  + 100m Freestyle

```

Race simulation for 400 IM competitors.

### IM Ladder

```wod
(50-100-150-200-150-100-50)

## Training Philosophy

IM training develops:

1. **Versatility**: Competence across all four strokes
2. **Weakness Identification**: Your weakest stroke becomes immediately apparent
3. **Transition Skills**: The often-overlooked skill of changing strokes efficiently
4. **Mental Toughness**: Pushing through the breaststroke when fatigued
5. **Overall Conditioning**: The variety engages different muscle groups

Many coaches believe every swimmer benefits from IM training, even those who specialize in a single stroke. The variety prevents overuse injuries and develops well-rounded aquatic fitness.
