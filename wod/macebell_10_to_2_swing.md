# Macebell 10-to-2 Swing

**Category**: Steel Mace / Macebell  
**Type**: For Time / Volume Training  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Description

The 10-to-2 Swing is considered the "real work" of macebell training by many practitioners, representing a more advanced and demanding variation of the foundational 360 Swing. Named after the positions of a clock face, this exercise involves swinging the mace from the 10 o'clock position to the 2 o'clock position (and vice versa) in a sweeping arc that crosses the midline of the body. This movement pattern develops exceptional shoulder stability, rotational power, and core strength while challenging coordination and proprioception in ways that traditional weight training cannot match.

Unlike the continuous circular motion of the 360 Swing, the 10-to-2 requires precise directional changes at the end ranges of the swing. This creates a more ballistic movement that demands greater control, timing, and strength. The exercise is named after the clock positions because when facing forward, the mace travels from your left side (10 o'clock) across your body to your right side (2 o'clock), requiring you to manage momentum changes at each end of the arc.

The 10-to-2 Swing is particularly valuable for athletes who need rotational power and stability, such as golfers, baseball players, tennis players, and combat athletes. The movement trains the obliques, transverse abdominis, and shoulder stabilizers in a coordinated pattern that directly transfers to rotational sports performance.

## How to Train It

### Prerequisites

Before attempting the 10-to-2 Swing, you should be proficient with the 360 Swing. The community consensus is that you should be able to perform at least 50 continuous 360 Swings per side with good form before progressing to the 10-to-2. This ensures that your shoulders, grip, and core are prepared for the increased demands of directional changes.

### Equipment Selection

Use a mace that is 5-10 lb lighter than what you use for 360 Swings, at least initially. The 10-to-2 requires more control and places greater stress on the shoulder joint, so err on the side of caution. Advanced practitioners may work up to 25-37 kg (55-81 lb) maces for the 10-to-2, but this represents years of dedicated practice.

### Setup and Starting Position

1. Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width
2. Hold the mace with both hands, with your dominant hand at the bottom of the handle
3. Position the mace to one side of your body, slightly behind the shoulder
4. Square your hips to the front and engage your core
5. Keep your eyes forward and chin neutral

### Execution Steps

1. **Initiate from the Core**: Begin the movement by rotating your torso, not by pulling with your arms
2. **Swing Across the Body**: Guide the mace in a sweeping arc across the front of your body
3. **Reach the End Range**: Allow the mace to travel to the opposite side, approximately to the 2 o'clock (or 10 o'clock) position
4. **Absorb and Redirect**: As the mace reaches the end range, absorb the momentum with your core and shoulder
5. **Reverse Direction**: Drive through your legs and rotate your torso to send the mace back in the opposite direction
6. **Maintain Control**: Keep the mace close to your body throughout the movement - it should trace a path around your head, not far from it

### Direction Variations

**Standard 10-to-2**: Swing from left to right (10 o'clock to 2 o'clock) and back, with the mace traveling around the back of the head

**Reverse 10-to-2**: Swing from right to left, reversing the direction of rotation

**Alternating 10-to-2**: Switch direction with each swing, changing at the bottom of the arc

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Attempting the exercise without mastering the 360 Swing first
- Using arms instead of core rotation to generate power
- Letting the mace drift too far from the body
- Failing to absorb momentum at the end ranges
- Looking at the mace instead of keeping eyes forward
- Starting with too heavy a weight

### Programming Recommendations

**For Beginners (After mastering 360 Swing)**:
- Practice 3x8-10 per side, 2-3 days per week
- Focus on smooth direction changes
- Use video analysis to check form
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets

**For Intermediate Practitioners**:
- Progress to 3x15-20 per side
- Add weight gradually (2-5 lb increments)
- Combine with 360 Swings in flows
- Practice alternating direction variations

**For Advanced Practitioners**:
- Work toward 50+ continuous swings per side
- Incorporate into complex flows with other movements
- Train with heavier maces (20+ lb)
- Add competition-style max weight attempts

### Integration with Other Movements

The 10-to-2 Swing pairs well with:
- 360 Swings (as a warm-up or in combination)
- Barbarian Squats (for full-body conditioning)
- Gravediggers (for additional rotational work)
- Mace Flows (connecting multiple movements seamlessly)

## Collectible Metrics

- **Reps per set**: Track repetitions completed per side
- **Direction changes**: Count clean direction changes in alternating sets
- **Weight progression**: Document increases in mace weight
- **Volume over time**: Total weekly rep count for periodization
- **Flow integration**: Ability to connect 10-to-2 with other movements without stopping
