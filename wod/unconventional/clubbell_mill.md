# Clubbell Mill

**Category**: Steel Club / Heavy Club / Clubbell  
**Type**: Ballistic / Flow Movement  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Advanced  

## Description

The Mill is the foundational movement of steel club training, analogous to what the swing is to kettlebell training. This circular swinging motion develops shoulder mobility, grip strength, core stability, and rotational power in a fluid, dynamic pattern. The movement involves swinging the club in an arc around the body, tracing a path that challenges the practitioner to maintain control while generating and absorbing momentum in a continuous flow.

Just as the kettlebell swing forms the foundation for cleans, snatches, and other ballistic movements, the Mill serves as the prerequisite skill for more advanced club exercises like the Shield Cast, Reverse Mill, and complex flows. Mastering the Mill develops the proprioceptive awareness, grip endurance, and rotational mechanics that underpin all heavy club training. The movement can be performed with one arm or two, and can be done in both clockwise (mill) and counter-clockwise (reverse mill) directions.

The Mill differs from mace swinging in that the club's center of mass is closer to the handle, creating a different leverage profile. This allows for a wider variety of grip positions and movement patterns while still challenging shoulder stability and core engagement. The Mill's circular path creates a traction effect on the shoulder joint, promoting mobility while building strength through a full range of motion.

## How to Train It

### Equipment Selection

Steel clubs typically come in weights ranging from 5 lb to 45 lb, with common sizes being 10 lb, 15 lb, 20 lb, 25 lb, and 35 lb. Beginners should start with a weight that allows them to maintain control throughout the entire range of motion - typically 10-15 lb for men and 5-10 lb for women. The leverage of the club means that even experienced athletes may need to start lighter than expected.

### Two-Hand Mill (Starting Position)

The two-hand mill is the starting point for all practitioners:
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold the club with both hands near the end of the handle
3. Position the club to one side of your body, resting on your shoulder
4. Keep your core engaged and spine neutral
5. Look forward, not at the club

### Execution Steps (Two-Hand Mill)

1. **Initiate the Swing**: Push the club away from your body, allowing it to swing in an arc
2. **Guide the Path**: Use your core rotation to guide the club around your back
3. **Feel the Float**: As the club passes behind you, there's a moment of weightlessness
4. **Catch and Continue**: Guide the club back around to the starting position
5. **Maintain Rhythm**: Keep the movement continuous and fluid

### Single-Arm Mill Progression

After mastering the two-hand mill:
1. Start with your dominant hand near the bottom of the handle
2. Use your free hand to spot or assist as needed
3. Progress to unassisted single-arm mills
4. Practice both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions
5. Eventually alternate between sides seamlessly

### Direction Variations

**Mill (Clockwise)**: The standard direction, swinging the club from outside to inside when viewed from above

**Reverse Mill (Counter-Clockwise)**: The opposite direction, essential for balanced shoulder development

**Alternating Mill**: Switching directions within a set, changing at the bottom of the swing

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using too heavy a club before mastering the movement
- Relying on arm strength instead of core rotation
- Looking at the club instead of keeping eyes forward
- Bending at the waist instead of rotating through the torso
- Practicing on slippery or unstable surfaces
- Neglecting the reverse mill direction

### Programming Recommendations

**For Beginners (Weeks 1-4)**:
- Practice two-hand mills: 3x10 per direction
- Focus on smooth, controlled movement
- Train 2-3 days per week
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets

**For Intermediate Practitioners (Months 2-6)**:
- Progress to single-arm mills: 3x10-15 per side
- Add reverse mills to each session
- Begin combining with shield casts
- Increase training frequency to 3-4 days

**For Advanced Practitioners (6+ months)**:
- Work up to 50+ mills per set
- Add weight progressively (20-35 lb clubs)
- Create flows combining mills, reverse mills, and casts
- Add EMOM protocols for conditioning

### Integration with Other Movements

The Mill pairs naturally with:
- Reverse Mills (for balanced development)
- Shield Casts (the most common combination)
- Side Presses (for pressing strength)
- Pullovers (for additional shoulder work)
- Complex flows connecting multiple movements

## Collectible Metrics

- **Reps per set**: Track total repetitions per direction and side
- **Duration**: For continuous flow practice, track time under the mace
- **Weight progression**: Document increases in club weight
- **Direction balance**: Ensure equal volume in both clockwise and counter-clockwise
- **Flow integration**: Ability to connect mills with other movements seamlessly
