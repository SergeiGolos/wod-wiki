# Macebell 360 Swing

**Category**: Steel Mace / Macebell  
**Type**: For Time / Volume Training  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Advanced  

## Description

The 360 Swing is the foundational movement of macebell training, often described as the "gateway drug" of macebells. This exercise involves swinging the mace in a controlled circular motion around the head, creating a 360-degree path that develops shoulder mobility, core stability, and grip strength. The movement originated from ancient Hindu and Persian wrestling traditions, where the gada (mace) was used to develop the strength and conditioning necessary for grappling sports.

The 360 Swing is unique because it combines ballistic movement with precise control, requiring the practitioner to manage the momentum of an unevenly weighted implement while maintaining structural integrity through the shoulders, core, and grip. Unlike traditional weight training that works muscles in isolation, the 360 Swing trains the body as an integrated unit, developing functional strength that transfers to athletic movements and daily activities.

## How to Train It

### Equipment Selection

Start with a lighter mace than you might expect. The leverage disadvantage of the mace means that even experienced athletes should begin with 5-10 lb (2-4 kg) maces. The long handle creates significant torque that multiplies the effective weight at the end of the swing. Common progression weights are 7 lb, 10 lb, 15 lb, 20 lb, and 25 lb, with practitioners typically advancing slowly through these levels over months or years of consistent training.

### Setup and Starting Position

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent
2. Hold the mace near the end of the handle with your dominant hand
3. Position the mace vertically with the head pointing upward
4. Place your other hand higher on the handle for support if needed
5. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout

### Execution Steps

1. **Initiate the Swing**: Begin by swinging the mace to one side, allowing the momentum to carry it in an arc
2. **Guide the Path**: Use your shoulder and core to guide the mace around your head in a circular motion
3. **Control the Float**: As the mace passes behind your head, there will be a moment of "float" where the weight is weightless - use this time to adjust your grip
4. **Catch and Redirect**: As the mace comes around to the front, catch it and redirect for the next repetition
5. **Maintain Tension**: Keep your core braced and shoulder packed throughout the movement

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Starting with too heavy a weight (the most common mistake according to community feedback)
- Allowing the shoulder to elevate or shrug during the swing
- Using excessive arm strength instead of whole-body movement
- Bending at the waist instead of rotating through the torso
- Practicing on unstable or slippery surfaces

### Programming Recommendations

**For Beginners (Weeks 1-4)**:
- Practice 3x10 360s per side, 3 days per week
- Focus on form over speed
- Use a mirror or video feedback
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets

**For Intermediate (Months 2-6)**:
- Progress to 3x15-20 per side
- Increase weight gradually (never more than 5 lb jumps)
- Add EMOM protocols for conditioning
- Begin combining with 10-2 swings

**For Advanced (6+ months)**:
- Work up to 100 continuous swings
- Practice alternating direction mid-set
- Combine with other mace movements in flows
- Progress to heavier weights (20+ lb)

### Safety Considerations

The 360 Swing places significant demand on the shoulder joint. Those with pre-existing shoulder issues should consult a medical professional before beginning. Always warm up thoroughly before practicing, and never train to failure with the mace - form breakdown can result in the mace striking the head, neck, or back. Practice in an open area with adequate clearance, and consider using a padded surface in case the mace is dropped.

## Collectible Metrics

- **Reps per set**: Track total repetitions completed per side
- **Total volume**: Daily and weekly rep counts for progressive overload
- **Weight used**: Document mace weight for strength progression
- **Time under tension**: For conditioning-focused sessions, track duration
- **Quality rating**: Self-assess form quality on a 1-10 scale each session
