# Lap Feature Examples

These examples demonstrate the different workout structures possible with the Lap Feature.

## Example 1: EMOM with Lap Groups

```
(30) :60 EMOM
  + 5 Pullups
  + 10 Pushups
  + 15 Air Squats
```

In this example, all three exercises are grouped together as a single workout unit to be completed within each 60-second interval, repeated 30 times. The `+` symbol indicates these are part of the same lap.

## Example 2: Traditional Rounds

```
(3)
  400m Run
  21 KB Swings 53lb
  12 Pullups
```

In this traditional format (no lap indicators), each exercise is performed in sequence, and the entire group is repeated 3 times.

## Example 3: Mixed Structure

```
(3)
  400m Run
  (30) :60 EMOM
    + 5 Pullups
    + 10 Pushups
    + 15 Air Squats
```

This example demonstrates a mixed structure where:
1. A 400m run is performed
2. A complete 30-round EMOM circuit is performed (with all three exercises as a lap group)
3. This entire sequence is repeated 3 times
