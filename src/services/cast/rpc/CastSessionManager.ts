/**
 * CastSessionManager — sender-side session orchestration for the cast stack.
 *
 * One module absorbs the four things every cast session needs after a
 * transport is connected:
 *
 *   1. Register a `ChromecastRuntimeSubscription` against the workbench
 *      `SubscriptionManager` so stack snapshots and outputs flow to the
 *      receiver.
 *   2. Build a `ChromecastEventProvider` so D-Pad events from the TV
 *      reach the local runtime via `runtime.handle(...)`.
 *   3. Run `ClockSyncService` to measure the sender/receiver clock offset
 *      — but only when the transport actually traverses a clock-skewed
 *      network (`transport.needsClockSync === true`).
 *   4. Cascade disposal: transport disconnect tears down subscription,
 *      event provider, and clock sync in one motion.
 *
 * Why a class, not scattered effects?
 * ------------------------------------
 * Before this module existed, those four concerns were wired up in five
 * different places: `CastButtonRpc`'s `connectSession` callback, the
 * re-adopt effect, the inline `useEffect` in `RuntimeTimerPanel`, the
 * receiver's `LocalReceiverApp` effect, and the receiver's
 * `setupTransport` callback. Adding a new RPC message type or changing
 * the subscription shape meant five updates.
 *
 * The handle returned by `connect()` exposes the three things the cast
 * button actually needs (transport, event provider, subscription). All
 * four lifecycle concerns are hidden behind that small surface.
 *
 * No React. No refs. No effects. The manager is constructed once per
 * page lifetime and `connect()` is called from the user's cast gesture.
