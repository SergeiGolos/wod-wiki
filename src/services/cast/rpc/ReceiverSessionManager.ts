/**
 * ReceiverSessionManager — receiver-side session orchestration.
 *
 * Owns the receiver half of the cast stack. Given a connected
 * `IRpcTransport`, it:
 *
 *   1. Builds a `ChromecastProxyRuntime` against the transport.
 *   2. Routes `rpc-audio` messages to the local `AudioService`
 *      (so the receiver plays the same cues as the sender).
 *   3. Subscribes to the runtime's workbench stream and exposes a
 *      single `onWorkbenchUpdate(handler)` stream for the React
 *      tree. Without this, every component that wants the workbench
 *      state would have to reach into the runtime's subscribe API.
 *   4. Surfaces transport disconnect through `onDisconnected(handler)`
 *      so the React tree can reset to the waiting screen.
 *
 * Two callers converge here:
 *   - `LocalReceiverApp` (local-tab dual-pane mirror): acquires a
 *     `BroadcastChannelRpcTransport` via `acquireLocalReceiverSession`,
 *     then hands it to `createReceiverSession`.
 *   - `ReceiverApp` (chromecast path): receives a WebRTC offer over
 *     CAF, creates a `WebRtcRpcTransport`, hands it to
 *     `createReceiverSession`.
 *
 * `dispose()` tears down the runtime, audio listener, workbench
 * stream, and disconnect subscriptions. The transport itself is
 * left to its owner (the React tree, the CAF signaling, or the
 * local-tab adapter).

 *   - `onDisconnected(handler)` — register a callback fired when the
