/**
 * ICastBackend — the port that hides whether casting is going through a real
 * Chromecast device, a local-tab dual-pane mirror, or some future adapter.
 *
 * Callers (the cast button) depend only on this interface. They never import
 * a concrete adapter. The factory in `getCastBackend.ts` picks an adapter
 * based on the build-time `VITE_CAST_BACKEND` env.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 * 1. `getCastBackend()` returns the singleton adapter for this build.
 * 2. The button observes `state` to drive its UI (spinner, green dot, hidden).
 * 3. The button calls `startSession()` from a user gesture. The promise
 *    resolves with a connected `IRpcTransport`, or throws on cancel/error.
 * 4. The transport is consumed by the rest of the stack (view session,
 *    WorkbenchCastBridge, etc.) — they don't know which backend produced it.
 * 5. The button calls `endSession()` to tear down the connection.
 *    `dispose()` is reserved for full cleanup (e.g. factory teardown in tests).
 *
 * State semantics
 * ---------------
 * The state stream is the *only* reactive surface the button should observe.
 * Adapters are responsible for keeping it consistent with their internals.
 *
 *   'unavailable'    — this backend cannot run in the current environment
 *                      (e.g. CAF in a non-Chrome browser). The button should
 *                      render hidden.
 *   'ready'          — backend is wired up and waiting for a user gesture.
 *   'connecting'     — `startSession()` is in flight. The button should show
 *                      a spinner.
 *   'session-active' — a transport has been produced; the user is casting.
 *                      The button should show its "active" indicator.
 *   'session-ended'  — the receiver went away (goodbye, TV unplugged, etc.).
 *                      The button should clean up and return to 'ready'.
 *
 * Cancellation
 * ------------
 * `startSession()` is the user gesture. The chromecast adapter throws on
 * user-cancel of the device picker. The local adapter opens a tab and either
 * resolves with a transport or throws on timeout (no popup, no cancel gesture).
 * Both errors are surfaced uniformly to the button's `try/catch`.
