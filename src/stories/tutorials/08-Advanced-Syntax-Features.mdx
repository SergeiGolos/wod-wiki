## Programming Strategies

### Periodization Example
```
# Week 1: Volume Phase
(5) 8 Back Squats 70%
(4) 12 Romanian Deadlifts 60%

# Week 2: Intensity Phase  
(5) 5 Back Squats 80%
(4) 8 Romanian Deadlifts 70%

# Week 3: Peak Phase
(3) 3 Back Squats 85%
(3) 5 Romanian Deadlifts 75%

# Week 4: Deload
(3) 5 Back Squats 60%
(3) 8 Romanian Deadlifts 50%
```

### Competition Preparation
```
# 8 Weeks Out: Volume
High rep, moderate intensity

# 4 Weeks Out: Intensity
Lower reps, higher weights

# 1 Week Out: Skill Practice
Light weights, perfect technique

# Competition Week: Maintain
Very light, movement quality only
```

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### ❌ Overcomplicating Syntax
```
(3 rounds) for time of 12 minutes maximum:
  400 meter run at moderate pace
  21 thrusters with 95 pound barbell
  12 pull-ups with chin over bar
```

### ✅ Clean, Effective Syntax
```
(3) 12:00 For Time:
  400m Run
  21 Thrusters 95lb
  12 Pull-ups
```

### ❌ Unclear Instructions
```
Heavy deadlifts
Some burpees
Run a bit
Rest when needed
```

### ✅ Specific Instructions
```
5 Deadlifts 85%
20 Burpees (no push-up)
400m Run (moderate pace)
Rest 2:00 (complete recovery)
```
