```

### Complex Workouts
```
AMRAP 20:00                # As Many Rounds As Possible in 20 minutes
EMOM 15:00                 # Every Minute On the Minute for 15 minutes
For Time:                  # Complete as fast as possible

```

## Visual Syntax Map

### Timer Symbols
- 🕐 `5:00` = **Countdown Timer** (counts down from 5:00 to 0:00)
- 🕐 `5:00^` = **Count-up Timer** (counts up for 5:00 duration)
- ⏱️ `:30` = **Short Timer** (30 seconds)

### Structure Symbols  
- 🔄 `(3)` = **Rounds** (repeat 3 times)
- 📋 `-` = **Group Start** (begin new exercise group)
- ➕ `+` = **Group Continue** (add to previous group)
- 📝 `[:text]` = **Special Action** (instructions/notes)

### Weight & Distance Symbols
- 🏋️ `lb/kg` = **Weight Units** (pounds/kilograms)
- 📏 `m/km/mi` = **Distance Units** (meters/kilometers/miles)
- 💪 `bw` = **Body Weight** (relative to body weight)
- 📊 `%` = **Percentage** (percentage of max)
