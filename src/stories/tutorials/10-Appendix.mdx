## Scaling Guidelines

### Beginner Modifications
```
Pull-ups → Ring Rows or Assisted Pull-ups
Handstand Push-ups → Pike Push-ups
Box Jumps → Step-ups
Double Unders → Single Unders
Muscle-ups → Pull-ups + Dips

Weight Scaling:
  Men: Start with 65lb for barbell movements
  Women: Start with 45lb for barbell movements
  Reduce by 20-30% if form breaks down
```

### Advanced Progressions
```
Push-ups → Handstand Push-ups
Air Squats → Pistol Squats
Pull-ups → Muscle-ups
Single Unders → Double Unders
Burpees → Burpee Box Jump Overs

Weight Progression:
  Increase by 5-10lb per week for upper body
  Increase by 10-20lb per week for lower body
  Use percentages for structured progression
```

## Programming Periodization

### Linear Progression
```
Week 1: 3x5 @ 80%
Week 2: 3x5 @ 82.5%
Week 3: 3x5 @ 85%
Week 4: 3x5 @ 87.5%
Week 5: Test new 1RM
```

### Block Periodization
```
Accumulation (4 weeks):
  High volume, moderate intensity
  Example: 5x8 @ 70%

Intensification (3 weeks):
  Moderate volume, high intensity
  Example: 5x3 @ 85%

Realization (1 week):
  Low volume, peak intensity
  Example: Work up to new 1RM
```

### Undulating Periodization
```
Monday: Power
  5x3 @ 60% (explosive intent)

Wednesday: Strength
  5x5 @ 80%

Friday: Hypertrophy
  3x10 @ 65%
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Parsing Errors
```
Error: "Invalid time format"
Fix: Use MM:SS format (e.g., 5:00 not 5.00)

Error: "Unknown weight unit"  
Fix: Use lb, kg, %, or bw (not pounds, kilograms)

Error: "Malformed round notation"
Fix: Use (3) not 3) or (3 or 3x

Error: "Invalid action syntax"
Fix: Use [:Setup] not [Setup] or :Setup:
```

### Performance Issues
```
Slow parsing on large workouts:
- Break into smaller sections
- Use comments to organize
- Avoid deeply nested structures

Memory usage with complex programs:
- Limit workout history storage
- Clear unused data periodically
- Use efficient data structures
```

### Browser Compatibility
```
Supported Browsers:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

Known Issues:
- Timer precision varies on mobile
- Monaco Editor requires modern browsers
- Some features need JavaScript enabled
```
