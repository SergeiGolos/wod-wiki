# Advanced Workout Features

Now that you're familiar with basic structures, let's explore some advanced features to make your workouts more precise and detailed.

## Adding Weights

Specify weights using numbers followed by units (lb or kg):

```
5 Deadlifts 225lb
10 Dumbbell Press 35lb
```

## Distance-Based Exercises

Add distance measurements for running, rowing, or other distance-based exercises:

```
400m Run
2000m Row
1 mile Jog
```

## Complex Round Schemes

Create pyramid or ladder workouts with varying rep schemes:

```
(21-15-9)
  Thrusters 95lb
  Pull-ups
```

Or:

```
(1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1)
  Push Press 95lb
  Burpees
```

## Count-up Timers

Use `^` to create a count-up timer:

```
5:00^ AMRAP
  5 Pull-ups
  10 Push-ups
  15 Air Squats
```

## Special Instructions

Add special instructions using square brackets:

```
[:Setup] Get your equipment ready
[:Rest] 2:00 between rounds
```

## Interactive Example

Try creating an advanced workout:

<SoundProvider>
  <ScreenProvider>
    <EditorWithState 
      code={"(3) 10:00\n  400m Run\n  15 Thrusters 95lb\n  10 Pull-ups\n  Rest 1:00"}
      height="300px"
    />
  </ScreenProvider>
</SoundProvider>
