# Getting Started with WOD Wiki

Welcome to WOD Wiki! This tutorial will help you get started with creating your first workout using our intuitive workout notation language.

## What is WOD Wiki?

WOD Wiki is a powerful workout notation system that lets you create structured, easy-to-follow workout routines using simple text. It's perfect for:

- Personal workout tracking
- Creating workout programs
- Sharing workout routines with others
- Following structured training plans

## Your First Workout

Let's start with a simple 5-minute warm-up:

```
5:00 Warm-up
  :30 Jump Rope
  :30 Rest
  :30 Arm Circles
  :30 Rest
  :30 Bodyweight Squats
  :30 Rest
  :30 Arm Swings
  :30 Rest
```

## How It Works

1. **Timers**: Use `MM:SS` format for time-based exercises
2. **Exercises**: Type the exercise name after the time
3. **Rest**: Use `Rest` to indicate rest periods

## Interactive Example

Try editing this example in the live editor below:

<SoundProvider>
  <ScreenProvider>
    <EditorWithState 
      code={"5:00 Warm-up\n  :30 Jump Rope\n  :30 Rest"}
      height="200px"
    />
  </ScreenProvider>
</SoundProvider>
