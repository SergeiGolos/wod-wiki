# Getting Started

Now that you've seen the syntax overview, let's walk through creating your first workout step by step.

## Writing Your First Workout

Let's start with a simple 5-minute warm-up. We'll build this step by step:

### Step 1: Basic Timer
```
5:00 Warm-up
```

### Step 2: Add Exercise Details
```
5:00 Warm-up
  :30 Jump Rope
  :30 Rest
```

### Step 3: Complete Structure
```
5:00 Warm-up
  :30 Jump Rope
  :30 Rest
  :30 Arm Circles
  :30 Rest
  :30 Bodyweight Squats
  :30 Rest
  :30 Arm Swings
  :30 Rest
```

## Basic Timers and Exercises

### Timer Formats
- **Seconds only**: `:30` (30 seconds)
- **Minutes and seconds**: `5:00` (5 minutes)
- **Hours, minutes, seconds**: `1:15:00` (1 hour 15 minutes)

### Exercise Naming
- Type the exercise name after the timer
- Use natural language: `Jump Rope`, `Push-ups`, `Air Squats`
- Include rest periods: `Rest`, `Active Rest`

### Basic Exercise Examples
```
:30 Plank
1:00 Wall Sit
:45 Mountain Climbers
2:00 Easy Jog
```

## Interactive Example

Try editing this example in the live editor below:

<SoundProvider>
  <ScreenProvider>
    <EditorWithState 
      code={"5:00 Warm-up\n  :30 Jump Rope\n  :30 Rest\n  :30 Arm Circles\n  :30 Rest"}
      height="200px"
    />
  </ScreenProvider>
</SoundProvider>

## Saving & Sharing Workouts

### Copying Your Workout
- Use the editor above to write your workout
- Copy the text to save it anywhere (notes app, email, etc.)
- Share the text with others - they can paste it into any wod.wiki editor

### Common Workout Structure
```
# Workout Title - Date
[:Setup] Equipment needed: Jump rope, mat

# Warm-up
5:00 Dynamic Warm-up
  :30 Arm Circles
  :30 Leg Swings
  :30 Jumping Jacks
  :30 Body Weight Squats

# Main Workout  
# (Your main exercises here)

# Cool Down
5:00 Static Stretching
  :45 Hamstring Stretch
  :45 Quad Stretch
  :45 Shoulder Stretch
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic timers and exercise names
2. **Use Natural Language**: Write exercises as you would say them
3. **Include Rest**: Don't forget rest periods between exercises
4. **Add Structure**: Use headers (`#`) to organize workout sections
5. **Add Notes**: Use `[:text]` for special instructions

## Next Steps
