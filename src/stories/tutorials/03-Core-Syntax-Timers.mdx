# Core Syntax: Timers

Timers are the foundation of most workouts in wod.wiki. They provide structure and pacing for your exercises.

## Timer Formats

### Seconds Only (`:SS`)
Use for short durations under one minute:

```
:30 Plank
:45 Wall Sit  
:15 Sprint
:10 Rest
```

### Minutes and Seconds (`MM:SS`)
The most common format for workout timers:

```
5:00 Run
2:30 Row
1:15 Bike
3:45 AMRAP
```

### Hours, Minutes, and Seconds (`HH:MM:SS`)
For longer endurance workouts:

```
1:00:00 Easy Bike
2:30:00 Long Run
1:15:00 Steady Row
```

## Count-up vs Count-down

### Count-down Timers (Default)
Standard timers count down from the specified time to zero:

```
5:00 Run          # Counts: 5:00 → 4:59 → 4:58 → ... → 0:00
:30 Plank         # Counts: 0:30 → 0:29 → 0:28 → ... → 0:00
```

### Count-up Timers (`^`)
Add `^` after the time to count up instead:

```
5:00^ AMRAP       # Counts: 0:00 → 0:01 → 0:02 → ... → 5:00
:30^ Work         # Counts: 0:00 → 0:01 → 0:02 → ... → 0:30
```

**When to use count-up:**
- AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) workouts
- Time trials or testing
- When you want to see time accumulating

## Timer Examples

### Basic Workout Timers
```
# Warm-up
5:00 Dynamic Warm-up
  :30 Arm Circles
  :30 Leg Swings
  :30 High Knees
  :30 Butt Kickers

# Main Workout
20:00^ AMRAP
  10 Push-ups
  15 Air Squats
  20 Sit-ups

# Cool Down
5:00 Static Stretching
```

### EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)
```
EMOM 12:00
  Min 1: 10 Burpees
  Min 2: 15 Box Jumps
  Min 3: 20 Air Squats
```

### Tabata Intervals
```
(8) Tabata 4:00
  :20 Work - Mountain Climbers
  :10 Rest
```

### Complex Timing
```
For Time:
  (3)
    5:00 Row
    Rest 2:00
  (2)  
    :30^ Max Burpees
    Rest 1:30
```

## Common Timer Patterns

### Interval Training
```
(5)
  :45 Work - Burpees
  :15 Rest
```

### Progressive Intervals  
```
Round 1: 1:00 Work, :30 Rest
Round 2: :45 Work, :30 Rest  
Round 3: :30 Work, :30 Rest
Round 4: :15 Work, :30 Rest
```

### Circuit Training
```
Circuit (3 rounds):
  :40 Push-ups
  :20 Rest
  :40 Squats  
  :20 Rest
  :40 Plank
  :20 Rest
  Rest 2:00 between rounds
```

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### ❌ Incorrect
```
5 minutes Run       # Don't write out "minutes"
5.00 Run           # Don't use periods 
5:60 Run           # Invalid time (60 seconds = 1:00)
```

### ✅ Correct  
```
5:00 Run           # Use colon format
:30 Plank          # Seconds-only format
1:00 Rest          # One minute rest
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand timers, let's explore repetitions and rounds - the other key building blocks of workouts.
