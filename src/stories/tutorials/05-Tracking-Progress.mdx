# Tracking Your Progress

In this final tutorial, we'll explore how to track and analyze your workout progress over time.

## Recording Results

Use the `@` symbol to record your results after each workout:

```
# 2023-10-15 - Back Squat
5x5 Back Squat @185lb

# 2023-10-22 - Back Squat
5x5 Back Squat @195lb

# 2023-10-29 - Back Squat
5x5 Back Squat @205lb
```

## Tracking PRs (Personal Records)

Mark PRs with `!`:

```
# 2023-10-15 - Deadlift
1RM Deadlift @315lb !
```

## Tracking Metcons

Record your time or rounds for metcon workouts:

```
# 2023-10-16 - Fran
21-15-9
  Thrusters 95lb
  Pull-ups
@ 4:32
```

## Notes and Comments

Add notes about how you felt, what you could improve, or other observations:

```
# 2023-10-17 - Running
5k Run @ 22:15
// Felt strong, negative split each mile
// Could push harder in the middle next time
```

## Interactive Example

Try tracking your own workout:

<SoundProvider>
  <ScreenProvider>
    <EditorWithState 
      code={"# 2023-10-15 - Back Squat\n5x5 Back Squat @185lb\n\n# 2023-10-22 - Back Squat\n5x5 Back Squat @195lb\n\n# 2023-10-29 - Back Squat\n5x5 Back Squat @205lb"}
      height="350px"
    />
  </ScreenProvider>
</SoundProvider>
