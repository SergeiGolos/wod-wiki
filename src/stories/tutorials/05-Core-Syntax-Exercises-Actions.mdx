### Special Actions

- Include rest instructions for clarity
- Add coaching cues for form reminders
- Note equipment changes or transitions

### Organization
```

# Warm-up Section
[:Coaching] Start easy, build intensity

```

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

pu                        # Don't abbreviate "Pull-ups"

```
