# Core Syntax: Repetitions & Rounds

Repetitions and rounds are essential for structuring strength training, conditioning workouts, and creating progressive exercise schemes.

## Plain Rep Counts

### Basic Repetitions
Simply specify the number before the exercise name:

```
10 Push-ups
15 Air Squats
20 Sit-ups
5 Pull-ups
```

### Rep-based Workouts
```
Strength Training:
  5 Back Squats 185lb
  5 Bench Press 135lb
  5 Deadlifts 225lb
  
Bodyweight Circuit:
  20 Push-ups
  30 Air Squats  
  25 Sit-ups
  15 Burpees
```

## Rounds: `(n)` Format

### Simple Rounds
Use parentheses to specify how many times to repeat a group of exercises:

```
(3)
  10 Push-ups
  15 Air Squats
  20 Sit-ups
```

This means: Do 10 push-ups, 15 air squats, and 20 sit-ups. Repeat this sequence 3 times total.

### Rounds with Timing
```
(5) 3:00
  200m Run
  Max Reps Push-ups
  Rest remainder of 3:00
```

### Nested Rounds
```
(3) Main Rounds
  (2) Mini Circuit
    10 Burpees
    15 Box Jumps
  Rest 2:00
```

## Complex Round Schemes: `(n-n-n)` Formats

### Pyramid Schemes
Varying rep counts across rounds - great for classic CrossFit workouts:

```
(21-15-9) "Fran"
  Thrusters 95lb
  Pull-ups
```

This means:
- Round 1: 21 Thrusters, 21 Pull-ups
- Round 2: 15 Thrusters, 15 Pull-ups  
- Round 3: 9 Thrusters, 9 Pull-ups

### Ladder Schemes
```
(1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1) Ladder
  Push Press 95lb
  Burpees
```

### Custom Progressions
```
(5-10-15-20) Ascending
  Deadlifts 185lb
  Box Jumps 24"

(20-15-10-5) Descending  
  Wall Balls 20lb
  Kettlebell Swings 53lb
```

## Changing Rep Schemes

### Mixed Rep Patterns
```
Workout:
  (3) Strength
    5 Back Squats 185lb
    Rest 2:00
    
  (21-15-9) Conditioning
    Burpees  
    Air Squats
    
  (5) Finisher
    :30 Plank
    :30 Rest
```

### Progressive Loading
```
Week 1: (3) 5 Back Squats 185lb
Week 2: (3) 5 Back Squats 195lb  
Week 3: (3) 5 Back Squats 205lb
Week 4: (3) 3 Back Squats 215lb
```

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### ❌ Incorrect
```
3 rounds of 10 push-ups    # Don't write out "rounds of"
(3 rounds)                 # Don't include "rounds" in parentheses
10x Push-ups               # Don't use "x" notation
```

### ✅ Correct
```
(3) 10 Push-ups           # Simple and clean
(21-15-9) Thrusters       # Clear pyramid scheme
5 Deadlifts 185lb         # Rep count before exercise
```
