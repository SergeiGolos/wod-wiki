# Basic Workout Structures

Now that you've created your first workout, let's explore how to structure more complex routines.

## Multiple Exercises

You can list multiple exercises one after another:

```
3 Rounds:
  10 Push-ups
  15 Air Squats
  20 Sit-ups
```

## Rounds

Use parentheses to specify rounds. The number before the parentheses indicates how many times to repeat the exercises:

```
(3)
  10 Push-ups
  15 Air Squats
  20 Sit-ups
```

## Timed Rounds

You can also create timed rounds:

```
(3) 5:00
  200m Run
  Max Reps Pull-ups
  Rest 1:00
```

## Groups

Use `-` to create exercise groups that are performed in sequence:

```
- 10 Push-ups
- 10 Sit-ups
- 10 Squats
```

## Interactive Example

Try creating your own workout structure:

<SoundProvider>
  <ScreenProvider>
    <EditorWithState 
      code={"(3)\n  10 Push-ups\n  15 Air Squats\n  20 Sit-ups"}
      height="250px"
    />
  </ScreenProvider>
</SoundProvider>
