 *

 * - Blocks initialize in constructors and register resources
 * - RuntimeStack.push() validates and stores blocks
 * - RuntimeStack.pop() orchestrates unmount → dispose → context.release → parent.next
 * - Blocks must implement dispose/unmount, but callers no longer manually dispose popped blocks
 * 
 * ## Performance Requirements
 * - All lifecycle methods should complete within 50ms
 * - Stack operations should be optimized for frequent push/pop cycles
 * - Memory usage should be minimized during execution
