/**
 * ExecutionContext manages a "turn" of execution.
 *
 * It wraps a runtime and ensures that all actions pushed during the turn
 * see a consistent frozen clock and share an execution depth limit.
 *
 * This class declares only the narrow {@link IRuntimeContext} surface — the
 * collaborators and verbs the execution world (actions, blocks, behaviors)
 * actually uses mid-turn. The wide `IScriptRuntime` members (subscribeTo*,
 * finalizeAnalytics, setAnalyticsEngine, pushBlock/popBlock, dispose) stay on
 * `ScriptRuntime` for external drivers; they are NOT re-declared here, so
 * adding a member to `IScriptRuntime` no longer forces a matching pass-through.
 *
 * ## Stack Semantics (LIFO)
 *
 * Actions are processed using a **stack** (Last-In-First-Out). When an action
 * produces child actions via `runtime.do()`, those children are pushed onto the
 * stack and executed **before** returning to any remaining sibling actions.
 *
 * This ensures that nested operations (e.g., a pop that triggers a parent.next()
 * which pushes a new child) complete their full depth before processing continues
 * at the parent level — mirroring the natural call-stack behavior of block
 * lifecycle operations.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * 1. Created by `ScriptRuntime.do()` or `ScriptRuntime.handle()` when no active context exists
 * 2. Clock is frozen at creation time (SnapshotClock)
 * 3. Actions are executed from the stack until empty
 * 4. Context is discarded — all actions in the turn shared the same frozen timestamp
