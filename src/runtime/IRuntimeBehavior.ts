/**
 * Generic, composable behavior contract applied to runtime blocks.
 *
 * Design goals:
 * - Constructor-configurable: concrete behaviors can accept arbitrary args in their constructors
 *   to control how they apply (targets, filters, thresholds, etc.).
 * - Application-time context: every hook receives both the script runtime and the specific block
 *   instance being acted upon.
 * - Optional hooks: implement only what you need; unimplemented hooks are skipped.
