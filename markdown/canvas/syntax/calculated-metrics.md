# Tuesday — Pull Day

```wod
rpe: 8
(5 Sets)
  5 Deadlifts 225lb
  5 Deadlifts ?lb
```

```calculate
totalLoad = sum(reps * weight)
avgRPE = mean(rpe)
setCount = count(reps)
```

The unknown load on the second deadlift set is skipped by the calculator, so the derived total only uses rows with complete inputs.
