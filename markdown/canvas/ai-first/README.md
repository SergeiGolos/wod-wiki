# AI-First Workouts {sticky dark full-bleed}

Text-based workout scripts are the perfect interface for AI. They're compact, unambiguous, and easy to generate, edit, and share.

```view
name:    ai-demo
state:   note
source:  wods/examples/getting-started/statement-1.md
runtime: in-memory
launch:  host
align:   right
width:   45%
```

## Why Text Wins {sticky #why-text theme:violet}

- **Portable** — copy-paste into any chat, note, or document
- **Versionable** — diff-friendly, git-friendly, review-friendly
- **Composable** — LLMs can generate, remix, and extend scripts without special tools
- **Executable** — the same text that reads well to humans runs live in the playground

```command
target: ai-demo
pipeline:
  - set-source: wods/examples/getting-started/statement-1.md
  - set-state: note
```

```button
